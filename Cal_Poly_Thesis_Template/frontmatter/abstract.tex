This thesis investigates the application of content-based music recommendation techniques to small-scale, specialized music archives, specifically the iPalpiti Music Archive. While large streaming platforms leverage massive user interaction datasets for collaborative filtering, niche archives often face the "cold start" problem and lack sufficient user data. This research adapts the methodology of Tamm et al. (2024) \cite{tamm2024}---who compared pretrained audio representations like MusicNN, MERT, and Jukebox---to evaluate their effectiveness in a small-domain context. By integrating these models into a modern AWS serverless architecture, this study aims to develop a cost-effective, scalable recommendation system. The project utilizes mock user data to train and compare backend models (KNN, Shallow Networks, and BERT4Rec) on frozen audio embeddings, ultimately determining the optimal configuration for enhancing music discovery in specialized libraries.
