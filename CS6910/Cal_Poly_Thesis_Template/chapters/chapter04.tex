\chapter{Evaluation Plan} \label{ch:Evaluation}

\section{Evaluation Strategy}
The specific evaluation metrics and experimental protocols are currently under development and will be finalized in the upcoming semester. The research will focus on establishing a robust framework for assessing both the recommendation quality (using the synthetic datasets) and the system efficiency (latency and cost) within the AWS environment.

\section{Evaluation Roadmap}

The detailed evaluation plan is a key objective for the next semester. The current research direction identifies the following areas for development:

\subsection{Algorithmic Accuracy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Metrics}: Investigation into appropriate metrics for small-scale, specialized archives (e.g., adapting standard ranking metrics like HitRate or NDCG).
    \item \textbf{Validation}: Development of a validation strategy to assess how well the models leverage the vector embeddings to solve the cold-start problem.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Performance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Benchmarks}: Definition of benchmarks for the serverless infrastructure.
    \item \textbf{Scalability}: Planning for scalability tests to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the proposed AWS architecture.
\end{itemize}
