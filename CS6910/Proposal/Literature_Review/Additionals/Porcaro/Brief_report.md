The Impact of Music Recommendation Diversity: A Longitudinal Study Briefing

Executive Summary

This document synthesizes the findings of a 12-week longitudinal study that investigated the long-term impact of music recommendation diversity on listeners' attitudes. The study exposed 110 participants from Southern Europe, largely unfamiliar with Electronic Music (EM), to daily recommendations of this genre. Participants were split into two groups: one receiving High Diversity (HD) recommendations spanning multiple EM subgenres, and another receiving Low Diversity (LD) recommendations focused on a single subgenre (trance).

The research demonstrates that music recommendations can be a powerful vehicle for attitudinal change. The level of diversity within these recommendations plays a critical role in shaping this impact.

Key Takeaways:

* Diversity Fuels Curiosity: Listeners exposed to high-diversity recommendations showed a significantly greater willingness to explore the unfamiliar music, accessing and interacting with playlists more frequently, even for tracks they explicitly disliked.
* Exposure Neutralizes Implicit Bias: Repeated exposure to EM recommendations, regardless of diversity, helped deconstruct pre-existing positive and negative attachments. Over the 12 weeks, participants in both groups developed a more neutral implicit association with the genre.
* Exposure Increases Openness: The study found that exposure to recommendations made participants more open to listening to EM. While the overall effect was modest and tended to decay after the exposure period, it indicates that recommendations can lower barriers to unfamiliar genres.
* Diversity Deconstructs Stereotypes: High-diversity recommendations were particularly effective at challenging and altering listeners' preconceived notions of EM. Participants in the HD group were significantly more likely to recognize the genre's variety, its suitability for different contexts beyond partying, and its use of acoustic instruments.

In conclusion, while any repeated exposure can influence listener attitudes, intentionally designing for diversity in music recommender systems can significantly enhance music discovery, broaden listeners' understanding of a genre, and break down stereotypes.

Study Overview

Objective

The study aimed to answer two primary research questions:

1. [RQ1] To what extent can listeners’ implicit and explicit attitudes towards an unfamiliar music genre be affected by exposure to music recommendations?
2. [RQ2] What is the relationship between music recommendation diversity and the impact on listeners’ attitudes?

The research provides a critical evaluation of how music recommender systems can act as a vehicle for attitudinal change, moving beyond behavioral metrics to assess impacts on opinions, beliefs, and stereotypes.

Methodology

The research employed a 12-week longitudinal user study involving 110 participants. The study was structured into four distinct stages, allowing for the measurement of attitudes before, during, and after a concentrated exposure period.

* Participants: 110 subjects were recruited from Southern Europe (Italy, Spain, Portugal). The selection criteria ensured a homogenous population in terms of demographics and cultural background to minimize response variability.
  * Age: 18-42 (91% between 18 and 32).
  * EM Familiarity: Prescreening filtered for participants who were not experts or frequent listeners of Electronic Music. Their self-declared listening habits indicated they listened to music regularly but not EM specifically. Listening log analysis confirmed that for most, EM constituted less than 15% of their total listening.
  * Demographics: Almost equally divided between binary genders (53% women, 44% men), with a small fraction of non-binary participants (3%).

Experimental Design

The 12-week study was divided into four stages, as illustrated in the study's high-level diagram.

Stage	Weeks	Activities
Prescreening	-	Participant selection via surveys and familiarity tests.
PRE	1-4	Baseline data collection: Listening logs via ListenBrainz and initial Electronic Music Feedback (EMF) questionnaire.
COND	5-8	Daily exposure to music recommendations (Listening Sessions). Weekly EMF questionnaire completion.
POST	9-12	No exposure. Final EMF questionnaire and End-of-Study (EoS) survey administered at the end of Week 12.

Experimental Groups

Participants were divided into two groups of 55 using covariate adaptive randomization to ensure a balanced baseline in terms of EM familiarity, openness, and implicit association.

* High Diversity (HD) Group: Exposed to 20 recommendation lists, each focused on a different one of 20 selected EM genres (e.g., ambient, drum and bass, house, techno). This approach maximized inter-list diversity.
* Low Diversity (LD) Group: Exposed to 20 recommendation lists, all focused on a single EM genre: trance. This approach minimized inter-list diversity while maintaining some variability through subgenres of trance.

For both groups, intra-list diversity was minimized by selecting four musically similar tracks for each daily session, ensuring a coherent listening experience.

Data Collection Methods

A multi-faceted approach was used to gather implicit and explicit feedback.

* Electronic Music Feedback (EMF) Questionnaire: A 10-minute survey administered six times to measure:
  * Openness (o-score): A Guttman scale assessing willingness to listen to EM for one hour at varying frequencies (e.g., monthly, weekly, daily).
  * Implicit Association (d-score): A Single Category Implicit Association Test (SC-IAT) measuring the valence (positive/negative) of automatic associations with EM.
  * Stereotypes: 5-point Likert items assessing opinions on listening contexts (e.g., partying, studying), musical properties (e.g., tempo, acousticness), and artist characteristics (e.g., gender, origin).
* Daily Listening Sessions: During the 4-week COND stage, participants listened to a 3-minute audio mix of EM track excerpts daily. Feedback collected included:
  * Liking: 5-point Likert item.
  * Familiarity: Rating of whether the music was familiar.
  * Playlist Access: A voluntary choice to explore a YouTube playlist of the full tracks, measuring curiosity.
  * Playlist Interaction: The view count on the private YouTube playlists, serving as a proxy for actual engagement.
* End-of-Study (EoS) Survey: A final qualitative survey to gather participants' overall perceptions of their relationship with EM before, during, and after the study.

Key Findings and Analysis

The study yielded significant insights into how recommendation diversity impacts listener attitudes. Of the initial 110 participants, data from 94 (45 HD, 49 LD) who completed the majority of tasks were analyzed.

1. Impact on Discovery and Curiosity

The most pronounced effect of diversity was its ability to generate curiosity.

* Playlist Access and Interaction: The HD group demonstrated a significantly higher willingness to explore the music. Mann-Whitney U tests confirmed that the HD group had statistically significant higher median playlist accesses and interactions than the LD group.
* Engagement Despite Dislike: A notable finding was that HD participants often chose to explore playlists even for listening sessions they rated negatively. This behavior was not observed in the LD group, suggesting that diverse recommendations sparked an exploratory interest independent of immediate preference. As one participant noted, "I discovered new artists that I really liked! Happy to have contributed to your study :)".
* Conclusion: Exposing listeners to a wide variety of unfamiliar music via high-diversity recommendations is a potent strategy for encouraging discovery and exploration.

2. Impact on Implicit Attitudes (d-score)

Exposure to recommendations helped moderate pre-existing biases towards EM.

* Trend Towards Neutrality: The analysis of the d-score revealed that participants in both groups tended to move from strong positive or negative implicit associations toward a more neutral stance. The group of participants with a neutral d-score grew from ~40% to ~50% in both groups by the end of the study.
* Role of Diversity: The level of diversity did not appear to be a significant factor in this shift. The change is attributed to the repeated exposure itself, which may deconstruct attachments by providing new, more varied information about the genre.
* Conclusion: Repeated recommendations of an unfamiliar genre can help listeners remove pre-existing positive and negative attachments, leading to a more neutral implicit attitude.

3. Impact on Openness to Listening (o-score)

The study found a general increase in participants' self-reported openness to EM.

* Increased Openness: A Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed a statistically significant increase in the o-score immediately following the 4-week exposure period. Participants became more willing to listen to EM.
* Effect Decay: This effect was less significant when measured four weeks after the exposure ended (in the POST stage), suggesting that the increase in openness may decay without continued exposure.
* Role of Diversity: While no statistically significant difference was found between the HD and LD groups overall, the data suggests diversity may be particularly motivating for participants who are initially the least open to a genre. A participant in the HD group commented that the study was "a good opportunity to learn about this musical genre."
* Conclusion: Exposure to recommendations can temporarily increase listeners' openness to an unfamiliar genre.

4. Impact on Stereotypes

Diversity proved highly effective in deconstructing stereotypes associated with Electronic Music.

* Challenging Core Stereotypes: Analysis of the EoS survey showed that after the study, participants in both groups were less likely to agree with statements like "I listen to EM only for partying" and "I believe Electronic Music has mostly fast tempo and high energy."
* Broadening Perceptions of Variety: The most significant difference between the groups appeared in their perception of the genre's breadth. Post-study, the HD group agreed much more strongly with statements like "I think of Electronic Music as a varied genre with several sub-styles" and "I believe that Electronic Music could fit in different contexts." The difference between the HD and LD groups on these items was statistically significant.
* Altering Perceptions of Musical Properties: The HD group, having been exposed to genres like Electroacoustic, significantly changed their opinion on the presence of acoustic instruments in EM. Before the study, 79% disagreed that EM had acoustic instruments; after, only about 50% disagreed. This change was not observed in the LD group, who listened only to trance.
* Conclusion: Exposing listeners to a diversified set of recommendations is a powerful tool for deconstructing pre-existing stereotypes and providing a more nuanced and accurate understanding of an unfamiliar music culture.

Conclusions and Implications

The study confirms that music recommender systems can have a long-term impact on listeners' attitudes, extending beyond simple consumption behavior.

* Answering the Research Questions:
  * [RQ1 - Impact of Exposure]: Exposure to music recommendations can significantly affect attitudes. It can increase openness, neutralize implicit biases, and challenge stereotypes associated with an unfamiliar genre.
  * [RQ2 - Role of Diversity]: Recommendation diversity is a crucial mediating factor. While any exposure can have an effect, high diversity is uniquely effective at generating curiosity, encouraging discovery, and providing listeners with a broader, more accurate mental model of a genre's variety and applicability.
* Implications for Recommender Systems: The findings advocate for the strategic use of diversity in system design. To foster genuine music discovery and broaden users' cultural horizons, platforms should consider integrating diversification techniques. This approach can help users learn about the full spectrum of a musical field, rather than reinforcing a narrow, stereotypical view, as visualized by the study's "geometric shapes" analogy where a user is shown squares, circles, and triangles instead of only squares. Such systems not only improve the user experience but also address concerns about the homogenization of culture driven by algorithms.
