\chapter{Discussion and Conclusion}

\section{Overview of Findings}
% Briefly restate the purpose of the study and summarize the main findings
% from Chapter 5 at a high level, without repeating numerical results.

\section{Implications for Backend Design in Classical Music Archives}
% Discuss what the observed results imply for designing
% embedding-based backends in classical music archives such as iPalpiti.
% Focus on model family selection and practical trade-offs.

\section{Limitations}
% Discuss the main limitations of the study:
% - small-scale dataset
% - reliance on metadata-based proxy tasks
% - limited number of evaluated models
% - offline evaluation without user interaction data

\section{Directions for Future Work}
% Outline possible extensions:
% - scaling to larger classical datasets
% - additional proxy tasks
% - fine-tuning or self-supervised pretraining on classical data
% - integration with user and context modeling
% - user-centered or listening-based evaluation

\section{Conclusion}
% Provide a concise concluding statement.
% Revisit Research Question 1 and summarize how it was addressed.
% Emphasize the contribution and potential impact of the work.
