\chapter{Experimental Results and Analysis}

This chapter outlines the experimental result structure for addressing Research Question~1, focusing on how backend audio embedding model families will be compared using ranking-based evaluation on predefined proxy tasks.


\section{Overview of Experiments}
% This section summarizes what was evaluated in this chapter.
% Emphasize that experiments are small-scale but methodologically consistent.

\section{Experimental Setup Summary}
% Concise recap of dataset subset, model families, similarity metric,
% index type, and evaluation cutoffs, for readers who jump directly to results.

\section{Results on Sanity Proxy: Composer-Based Retrieval}
% Brief description of the proxy task and evaluation setup.

\textbf{Model / Family} & \textbf{NDCG@K} & \textbf{Precision@K} & \textbf{Recall@K} \\
\hline
CNN-based model A         & -- & -- & -- \\
CNN--RNN hybrid model B   & -- & -- & -- \\
Transformer-based model C & -- & -- & -- \\
Compact model D           & -- & -- & -- \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% Short interpretation of the results.

\section{Results on Primary Musical Proxy: Character Similarity (Heavy vs.\ Light)}
% Brief description of the proxy task and evaluation setup.

\begin{table}[t]

\caption{Ranking performance on the primary musical proxy (character similarity).}
\label{tab:results_primary_musical_proxy}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}

\textbf{Model / Family} & \textbf{NDCG@K} & \textbf{Precision@K} & \textbf{Recall@K} \\
\hline
CNN-based model A         & -- & -- & -- \\
CNN--RNN hybrid model B   & -- & -- & -- \\
Transformer-based model C & -- & -- & -- \\
Compact model D           & -- & -- & -- \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% Short interpretation of the results.

\section{Cross-Task Comparison and Model Family Trends}
% This section will compare trends observed across the sanity and musical proxies,
% focusing on whether relative performance differences between model families
% are consistent across proxy types.
% This comparison is intended to reveal whether relative differences
% between model families persist across proxies with different semantic roles.

\section{Exploratory Analysis: Architectural Factors (Not Included in V1.2)}
% This section is intentionally left for future extensions.
% Exploratory analysis of architectural factors is deferred to future work
% and is not part of the core claims of this thesis.


\section{Summary of Findings}
% This section will summarize key observations from the sanity and musical proxies
% and highlight condition-dependent insights related to model capacity.
% Detailed interpretation is deferred to Chapter~6.
