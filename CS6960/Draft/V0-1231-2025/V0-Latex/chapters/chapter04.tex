\chapter{Evaluation Roadmap}

The detailed evaluation plan is a key objective for the next semester. The current research direction identifies the following areas for development:

\section{Algorithmic Accuracy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Investigation into appropriate metrics for small-scale, specialized archives (e.g., adapting standard ranking metrics like HitRate or NDCG).
    \item Development of a validation strategy to assess how well the models leverage the vector embeddings to solve the cold-start problem.
\end{itemize}

\section{System Performance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Definition of benchmarks for the serverless infrastructure.
    \item Planning for scalability tests to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the proposed AWS architecture.
\end{itemize}
