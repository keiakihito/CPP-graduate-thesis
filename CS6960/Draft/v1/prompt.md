# Task 1: Research reframing (text only, no LaTeX yet)

Please help me reframe my thesis at a conceptual level.

Context:
- Original V0 tried to imitate Tamn et al. and compare backend embeddings + collaborative filtering.
- New V1 focuses ONLY on backend audio embeddings.
- We compare different model families (e.g., CNN-based, RNN-based, others).
- Target domain is classical music (iPalpiti archive), not general pop music.
- Evaluation is done via proxy tasks and ranking metrics (NDCG, Precision@K, Recall@K).

Deliverables:
1. A refined problem statement
2. 1–2 clear research questions
3. Expected contributions of this thesis (bullet points)

Please keep this aligned with an MVP Master’s thesis.



# Task 2: Literature review restructuring

Task 2: Literature Review Restructuring (V0 → V1)

Context:
I already have a literature review written for V0.
/Users/keita-katsumi/Dropbox/Academic/CalPolyPomona/Thesis/CPP-graduate-thesis/CS6960/Literature_Review

I believe the original version included collaborative filtering, user data,
and imitation of Tamm et al.

In V1, the thesis scope is narrowed to:
- Backend-only audio embedding comparison
- Classical music domain (iPalpiti archive)
- Proxy tasks and ranking-based evaluation (NDCG, Precision@K, Recall@K)

Goal:
I want to keep as much of the existing literature review as possible after year of 2020,
but reinterpret and reorganize it to support the new V1 scope.

Please do the following:
1. Identify which parts of the existing literature review still
   directly support backend audio embedding comparison.
2. Identify which parts should be:
   - de-emphasized,
   - reframed,
   - or moved to background/related work
   (e.g., collaborative filtering, user-based recommendation).
3. Propose a revised literature review structure with section titles,
   ordered logically for the V1 thesis.

Important constraints:
- Do NOT write full paragraphs.
- Do NOT add new citations.
- Focus on structure and rationale only.
- Clearly explain *why* each section belongs in the new structure.







Task 3: Thesis structure for V1 (chapter-level)

Please propose a chapter-level structure for my V1 thesis.

Constraints:
- Follow a standard CS Master’s thesis format.
- Emphasize backend system design + embedding evaluation.
- Methodology should be written as a placeholder, assuming future expansion.
- Results may be partial (small number of songs/models).

For each chapter, include:
- Purpose of the chapter
- What is finalized vs what is provisional (V1)

No LaTeX code yet.




Task 4: Draft key sections for V1

Please draft:
1. Abstract
2. Introduction
3. Conclusion (V1-level, preliminary)

Assumptions:
- Experiments are small-scale but methodologically sound.
- Results are interpreted cautiously.
- Emphasize future scalability and extension.

Tone:
- Honest
- Academic
- Clear about limitations



Task 5: Methodology placeholder

Please draft a Methodology section as a structured placeholder.

Include:
- Overall pipeline description
- Candidate model families (CNN, RNN, others)
- Embedding generation
- Similarity search / ranking
- Evaluation metrics
- Explicit notes on what is fixed vs what will be expanded later

This section should read as “designed but not fully executed yet”.
