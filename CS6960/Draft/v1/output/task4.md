### 1. Abstract

Learned audio embeddings are increasingly used to support music recommendation and similarity search, yet most existing work and deployed systems are optimized for large, heterogeneous, often pop‑centric catalogs. In contrast, curated classical music archives such as the iPalpiti collection lack large‑scale user interaction data and exhibit different structural properties, raising questions about how alternative audio embedding models behave in this domain. This thesis investigates the performance of multiple backend audio embedding model families on classical music similarity and retrieval tasks, focusing on convolutional, recurrent, hybrid, and transformer‑based architectures. Using a consistent offline evaluation pipeline, raw audio from the iPalpiti archive is transformed into embeddings, indexed for nearest‑neighbor search, and evaluated on metadata‑defined proxy tasks (e.g., retrieving tracks from the same work or performer). Ranking quality is assessed with standard information retrieval metrics, including NDCG, Precision@K, and Recall@K.  

The experimental study, conducted at modest scale, compares families of pretrained models rather than exhaustively tuning any single architecture. Results indicate that certain lightweight convolutional and hybrid models can achieve competitive or superior ranking performance to more complex architectures in this classical setting, though differences vary across proxy tasks and evaluation cutoffs. The analysis highlights architectural and representational choices that most influence ranking quality in this domain, while also illustrating the limitations of offline proxy evaluation. The thesis concludes with practical recommendations for backend embedding selection in classical music archives and identifies directions for future extension.

### 2. Introduction

Modern music streaming platforms rely heavily on machine learning to support search, recommendation, and discovery. Much of the prior work in this area, as well as many industrial systems, is built around large‑scale collaborative filtering and deep models trained on extensive user interaction logs. While effective for mainstream catalogs, these approaches are ill‑suited to small, curated archives that lack dense user data and whose mission emphasizes exploration over pure popularity. Classical music archives such as the iPalpiti collection exemplify this setting: they contain high‑quality, stylistically coherent recordings but limited usage data, and they require tools that can surface musically meaningful relationships among works, performances, and artists.  

In such environments, content‑based methods driven by audio embeddings become central. Recent advances in pretrained audio models—including convolutional networks, recurrent architectures, hybrid CNN–RNN and CNN–Transformer designs, and self‑supervised transformers—have made it possible to encode rich musical information in fixed‑length vectors. However, most evaluations of these models focus on genre or tag classification in popular‑music datasets, or on recommendation tasks for broad, heterogeneous catalogs. It remains unclear how different embedding families compare when applied specifically to classical music, and how their design choices impact ranking performance in realistic similarity and retrieval tasks for archives like iPalpiti.  

This thesis addresses that gap by focusing exclusively on the backend: the stage that maps audio recordings to embeddings and supports similarity search, independent of full end‑to‑end user modeling. We formulate a set of metadata‑based proxy tasks—such as retrieving other recordings of the same work or performances by the same ensemble—and evaluate multiple pretrained embedding families under a shared classical corpus and evaluation protocol. Ranking quality is quantified using standard metrics from information retrieval, including NDCG, Precision@K, and Recall@K, enabling a controlled comparison across architectures.  

The primary research question guiding this work is: for a classical music archive (iPalpiti), how do different backend audio embedding model families (e.g., CNN‑based, RNN‑based, and alternative architectures) compare in terms of ranking performance on proxy similarity and retrieval tasks, as measured by NDCG, Precision@K, and Recall@K? A secondary, exploratory question asks which characteristics of the embedding models—such as temporal modeling strategy, input representation, or embedding dimensionality—are most associated with improved ranking performance on these tasks. Together, these questions frame the thesis as a systematic, if small‑scale, study of backend design choices for classical music retrieval.  

This work makes three main contributions. First, it provides a focused empirical comparison of several backend audio embedding model families on a classical music archive using consistent preprocessing, indexing, and evaluation procedures. Second, it establishes a set of proxy tasks and ranking‑metric baselines tailored to classical music, which can be reused or extended in future studies. Third, it distills the experimental findings into practical recommendations for selecting and deploying audio embeddings in small, content‑driven archives, and identifies limitations and opportunities for integrating these backends into richer, user‑aware systems. The remainder of the thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 2 reviews related work on audio embeddings, evaluation strategies, and system design for music recommendation. Chapter 3 formalizes the problem setting and describes the overall backend pipeline. Chapter 4 details the methodology and experimental design. Chapter 5 presents and analyzes the results. Chapter 6 discusses implications, limitations, and directions for future work.

### 3. Conclusion (V1‑level, preliminary)

This thesis examined how different backend audio embedding model families perform on classical music similarity and retrieval tasks in the context of the iPalpiti archive. By holding the evaluation pipeline fixed—audio preprocessing, embedding extraction, indexing, and ranking—and varying only the embedding models, we obtained a controlled view of how architectural choices affect ranking quality as measured by NDCG, Precision@K, and Recall@K on metadata‑defined proxy tasks. Within the limits of a small‑scale study, the results suggest that carefully designed convolutional and hybrid architectures can provide strong baselines for classical music retrieval, sometimes matching or exceeding more complex models whose advantages are less pronounced in this domain.  

At the same time, the analysis underscores several important caveats. The experiments rely on a finite subset of the iPalpiti collection and on proxy notions of relevance derived from metadata (e.g., same work or performer), rather than real user interactions or listening studies. The set of evaluated models is necessarily incomplete, and resource constraints limit extensive hyperparameter tuning or exploration of very large architectures. Consequently, the conclusions should be interpreted as indicative rather than definitive: they highlight promising directions for backend design in classical archives but do not close the question of which embeddings are universally “best.”  

Despite these limitations, the work provides immediate value for practitioners and researchers working with similar collections. It offers concrete evidence about how a range of embedding families behave on classical material, along with a reusable evaluation protocol and baseline results. For archives that currently lack any automated similarity or recommendation tools, even a simple implementation of the better‑performing models and ranking procedures described here could meaningfully improve search and discovery.  

Future work can extend this foundation in several directions. On the modeling side, expanding the set of architectures, incorporating task‑specific fine‑tuning, and exploring self‑supervised pretraining directly on classical corpora may yield further gains. On the evaluation side, larger datasets, richer proxy tasks, and user‑centered studies—such as listening experiments or interactive recommendation trials—are needed to validate how offline metrics translate to real listener experience. Finally, integrating the backend embeddings into end‑to‑end systems that account for user preferences, context, and diversity objectives will be essential to realize the full potential of content‑based recommendation for classical music archives.
