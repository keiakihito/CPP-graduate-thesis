# review prompt

I am finalizing the Literature Review chapter of my master's thesis (audio embedding models for music retrieval in small-scale classical archives).

Please review the full chapter below and evaluate the following:

1. Does the literature review appear sufficiently grounded for a master's thesis?
2. Are there sections that appear under-cited relative to their conceptual weight?
3. Would adding:
   - one 2020+ survey paper,
   - one 2020+ self-supervised audio representation paper,
   - or one 2020+ ranking evaluation paper
   meaningfully strengthen the chapter?
4. If additional citations are recommended, specify exactly:
   - Which section needs reinforcement
   - What type of paper (survey, empirical, theoretical)
   - Why it would improve conceptual robustness

Do not suggest citations unless they clearly strengthen structural grounding.
Avoid recommending citations just to increase count.

Here is the chapter:

## response
Based on the updated text (Introduction, Literature Review, and Bibliography), here is the evaluation of your chapter. 1. Does the literature review appear sufficiently grounded for a master's thesis? Yes, structurally, but there is a critical imbalance in evidentiary weight. The chapter effectively establishes a narrative arc: Classical Archives → Need for Embeddings → Model Families → Evaluation. However, the Evaluation Strategies (Section 3)—which is the theoretical foundation for your thesis methodology—is the least grounded section. You currently have strong citations for User Modeling (Section 4) (e.g., Lin 2025, Abbattista 2024), which you explicitly state is not the focus of your thesis. Conversely, the section defending your choice of ranking metrics (Section 3) relies almost entirely on uncited assertions. For a master's thesis, you cannot claim "Prior work employs..." without citing that prior work. 2. Are there sections that appear under-cited relative to their conceptual weight? Yes. Two specific sections make broad claims about the state of the field without evidence: • Section 3.1 (Classification-Based Evaluation): You write: "Many studies evaluate audio embeddings using classification tasks... metrics such as accuracy... are commonly reported". ◦ The Issue: You do not cite a single study that does this. To prove this is a common practice that you are critiquing, you must cite a paper that evaluates embeddings via classification. • Section 3.2 (Ranking-Based Evaluation): You write: "For recommendation and retrieval systems, ranking-based metrics... are more appropriate". ◦ The Issue: This is a methodological claim. You need an authority to back up the statement that NDCG/Recall are the standard for this task. (Note: You have Schedl 2021 in your bibliography; this book likely contains the support you need for this specific sentence, but it is currently not cited here). 3. Would adding the suggested papers meaningfully strengthen the chapter? • One 2020+ Survey Paper: Yes. • One 2020+ Self-Supervised Audio Paper: Yes. • One 2020+ Ranking Evaluation Paper: Yes (or utilize your existing bibliography). 4. Recommended Additions (Specifics) Here are the specific locations to reinforce the chapter: A. One 2020+ Survey Paper • Location: Section 2 (Backend Audio Embedding Model Families) - Introduction. • Current State: You assert that MIR has explored "a range of architectural approaches." • Recommendation: Insert a survey paper citation at the end of the first paragraph of Section 2. • Why: This validates your taxonomy (CNN vs. Hybrid vs. Transformer). It proves that these categories are recognized by the community, rather than being an arbitrary grouping you invented. B. One 2020+ Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) Paper • Location: Section 2.3 (CNN–Transformer...). • Current State: You state: "Transformer-based architectures are commonly pretrained on large-scale datasets..." • Recommendation: Cite a foundational paper on self-supervised audio representation learning here (e.g., specific to contrastive learning or masked auto-encoders in audio). • Why: This explains why these models have "higher model capacity". The power of these models often comes from the training method (SSL) as much as the architecture (Transformer). Citing the method strengthens your argument about their "representational flexibility." C. One 2020+ Ranking Evaluation Paper (or utilize Schedl 2021) • Location: Section 3.2 (Ranking-Based Evaluation). • Current State: You claim ranking metrics are "more appropriate" without proof. • Recommendation: Cite Schedl et al. (2021) or a dedicated evaluation paper here. • Why: Your thesis methodology relies on these metrics. You must establish that this is standard scientific practice in Recommender Systems. Schedl 2021 ("Music Recommendation and Discovery") almost certainly contains a chapter on evaluation metrics; citing it here grounds your methodology in established textbook theory. D. (Bonus) Evidence of "Classification-Based Evaluation" • Location: Section 3.1. • Recommendation: You need to cite an example of a paper that falls into the trap you are describing (using accuracy to judge embeddings). • Why: You are setting up a "straw man" argument to knock down. You need to prove the "straw man" actually exists in the literature. Summary Your chapter is well-written, but you are currently citing your "Background" (User Modeling) better than your "Core" (Evaluation). By adding the citations suggested above—specifically supporting the claims in Section 3—you will align the citation density with the conceptual importance of the sections.
