I am writing a master's thesis evaluating audio embeddings for similarity-based music retrieval in a small-scale classical music archive.

I use ranking-based metrics such as NDCG, Precision@K, and Recall@K.

Please identify peer-reviewed research papers (2020 or later) in:

- Recommender Systems
- Music Information Retrieval (MIR)
- Content-based recommendation
- Similarity-based retrieval

that:

1. Justify the use of ranking-based metrics such as NDCG, Precision@K, or Recall@K.
2. Discuss the theoretical motivation behind ranking evaluation.
3. Analyze limitations of ranking metrics under small candidate sets, sparse data, or constrained datasets.
4. Compare ranking-based evaluation with classification-based evaluation in recommendation settings.

For each paper:
- Provide full citation.
- Indicate publication venue (ACM, IEEE, ISMIR, RecSys, etc.).
- Briefly explain how it strengthens methodological grounding for ranking-based evaluation.
- Specify whether it is survey-based, theoretical, or empirical.

Only include real, verifiable publications.
Do not suggest papers outside 2020+.
Do not hallucinate citations.
