## section 1


Hi Gemini, I want you to critically review the following Introduction section of my master's thesis in sectoin 1 first.

Context:
This thesis investigates whether increasing embedding-model capacity meaningfully improves content-based music similarity retrieval in a small-scale classical music archive (iPalpiti). 

The core research design is hypothesis-driven:
- Hypothesis: In a small-scale, single-domain dataset, increasing embedding-model capacity does not necessarily improve retrieval performance.
- RQ1: How does embedding-model capacity influence retrieval performance?
- RQ2: Under what conditions do higher-capacity models provide meaningful gains?

The research follows a Research-TDD mindset:
1. State a hypothesis.
2. Attempt to falsify it.
3. Identify conditions where it breaks.
4. Formulate conditional claims based on surviving boundaries.

Your task:
1. Check whether Section 1 clearly reflects this capacity-centered, hypothesis-driven research direction.
2. Identify any sentences that drift toward a generic “model comparison” or “evaluation framework” narrative rather than the capacity-focused research question.
3. Evaluate whether the Contributions section aligns tightly with the research questions and hypothesis.
4. Point out any logical gaps between:
   - Problem statement
   - Research questions
   - Hypothesis
   - Contributions
5. Suggest concrete sentence-level improvements only where alignment is weak.

Be strict and analytical. Focus on conceptual alignment, not grammar.
