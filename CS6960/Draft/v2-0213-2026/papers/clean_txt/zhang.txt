In today’s era of big data with excess information, music is common and everyday, which shows the huge amount of music data.
How to obtain one’s favorite music from the massive music database has become a problem, and the emergence of music recommendation systems is also inevitable. In this paper, we take digital piano music as the research object, form comprehensive features using spectrum and notes, design classiﬁcation methods using convolutional neural networks, and further process the classiﬁcation results and design recommendation algorithms. The basic method of music recommendation of this algorithm is to determine the structure of the network model, determine the corresponding training model, and improve the parameters on the basis of the typical source network model used in the system experiment. Historical behavior chooses to collect information. Then, it reads the audio data on the system and retrieves it from Mel, which reveals the identity of the music. The classiﬁcation proposal achieves its goal by denying the similarity between customer preferences and the potential of two musical characteristics. Two recommended methods based on convolutional neural networks are tested in this article. On the whole, the accuracy of the user’s comprehensive feature, recommendation method is higher than the recommendation accuracy rate of the multicategory user. In the comparison experiment of the single-category and multicategory recommendation methods, the average accuracy rate of single-category user feature recommendation is 50.35%;
and the recommendation accuracy rate of multicategory user features is higher than the recommendation accuracy rate of single-category user features. The experimental results show that the two recommendation methods can achieve better recommendation results.

1. Introduction 1.1. Background. While multimedia technology is developing rapidly following the pace of the times, we have also entered the era of big data with massive amounts of data. Music is one of the contents of multimedia information. While there is a huge user demand, its own data volume is also very considerable and continues to grow [1]. Nowadays, with abundant music resources, how to eﬃciently obtain the songs of interest in the vast and complicated sea of music, a targeted solution of a personalized music recommendation system is proposed. Music recommendation algorithms predict and push user behavioral preferences based on user behavioral information and music characteristics. The development of music recommendation algorithm has also shifted from the

technical route recommended by users’ personal preferences to the mutual recommendation among users. In recent years, the focus of attention has been on tapping potential preferences. In general, the technology of music recommendation algorithms is getting better and better.
1.2. Signiﬁcance. Amounts of data, diﬀerent groups of people have diﬀerent understandings and feelings of music, and a single attribute recommendation algorithm cannot meet the diverse and personalized needs of users. The music recommendation system that emerged from the massive music database is at a time when the data sea is becoming more and more complicated and full of personalized needs. The original recommendation algorithm needs to solve the original problems while upgrading itself. The implementation

and development of the same big data has also brought new computer technology, which can provide help in designing and improving the accuracy of the algorithm.
1.3. Related Work. Combining previous research on neural network recommender systems based on deep learning by domestic and foreign scientists with research results in these
ﬁelds, there is still plenty of room for expansion of music recommendation systems. In it, Liu et al. reported new behavior and comments based on a standard agreement
(NERAR) for approval that combines features and recommendations. A large number of experiments show that the established model is better than the most advanced recommendation model in terms of recommendation accuracy
[2]. Anantha and Battula use a pretrained model to extract knowledge from the data using the concept of transfer learning. The established model uses the knowledge of the pretrained model to extract patterns between users and items.
In order to achieve this goal, the article introduces a method to generate recommendations in two stages. In the classiﬁcation stage, the classiﬁcation of product images and its experimental analysis is discussed next. The ranking stage and its experimental analysis of sorting product images to users are discussed. The result analysis of the discussion has achieved gratifying results [3]. In order to overcome the problem of making recommendation diﬃcult as the number of products and users increase, Son and Shim proposed a matrix factorization algorithm that uses text data related to products.
Among matrix factorization algorithms, a word-level convolutional neural network method is used to extract word-level features to eﬀectively reﬂect text data. There is a problem with word-level convolutional neural networks; that is, there are a lot of parameters to learn. Therefore, in their research,
they proposed a matrix factorization method that uses character-level convolutional neural networks to extract character-level features from text data. In addition, in order to verify the performance of the proposed matrix factorization method, experiments were carried out using real data
[4]. To solve the problems of the personalized recommendation system, the main purpose of this model by Zhang et al.
is to study social connections and trust relationships among users and recommend places of interest to users through social impact and geographic information between users and tourist attractions. The results of the data prove the feasibility and eﬀectiveness of the model algorithm actually proposed by them, providing better prediction accuracy compared to other recommended algorithms [5]. Based on the theory of social communication, Bi et al. proposed an eﬀective social reference network model. It combines the attention mechanism and bidirectional LSTM in the same frame and uses multilayer perceptrons [6]. In their research,
Lee et al. proposed an automatic melody extraction algorithm using deep learning. In this algorithm, the feature image generated by the band energy is extracted from the chord audio ﬁle [7]. In order to solve the problem of ﬁnding one’s interest in a wide range of products, Yan Y et al. proposed a model algorithm that uses a binary convolutional neural network and radical basis function (RBF). They preprocess the input data to 0 or 1 based on the convolutional

Mobile Information Systems neural network, which can fully save the data storage and space, and the side help improves the eﬃciency of the recommendation. They also use RBF to establish a kinship network and make recommendations based on useful information screened out by similar users in the kinship network [8]. However, the above-mentioned studies need to learn a large number of parameters, which require a large amount of labeled training data and a large amount of professional knowledge to ensure correctness, ignoring issues such as the importance of the strength of the relationship between users of diﬀerent levels in the network.
1.4. Innovation. For modern people who always carry smart phones in their daily lives, listening to music is a very personal and contextual behavior. The rapid development of mobile devices and cloud-based music services enables consumers to enjoy music, anytime and anywhere [9, 10].
Therefore, there is an increasing demand for researching smart technologies to promote context-aware music recommendation. At this stage, the commonly used music system recommendation algorithms are divided into two methods:
content-based and context-based. The theme of this paper is to take digital music as the research object, design and classify the music recommendation system based on convolutional neural network [11, 12], and further process the recommendation algorithm model in combination with personal preference information.

2. Music Recommendation Technology Based on Curly Neural Network In order to adapt to people’s increasingly personalized needs and the rapidly increasing amount of information, music recommendation technology proposes personalized recommendations. Music recommendation based on user tastes is one of the hottest applications in the ﬁeld of personalized recommendation at present, and personalized recommendation is indispensable on all major music websites at home and abroad, which shows the importance of recommendation systems. For the classiﬁcation of recommendation algorithms, extending the development on the original basis, it is mainly divided into content recommendation algorithm and context recommendation algorithm [13] and deep learning recommendation algorithm [14] according to diﬀerent objects.
2.1. Content-Based Recommendation Algorithm System. The core point of content-based recommendation algorithm is to recommend items with a high degree of similarity based on historical selection behaviors that have been liked [15].
In digital music, it refers to extracting audio data as a music carrier, extracting part of the underlying sound characteristics through audio signal analysis to calculate similarity,
and then constructing a data structure describing their preferences through audio similarity, and then using the similarity of user models to judge the similarity of two music to achieve the purpose of recommendation [16, 17]. The process of this recommendation algorithm has three steps.

As shown in Figure 1, the three parts are as follows: ﬁrst,
extract some features for products that users have liked in the past. Second, based on the extracted features of disliked in the past, a comprehensive analysis of the likes is made.
Third, recommend the most similar products for users by comparing the preference characteristics and the characteristics of favorite items [18].
In digital music, it is the study of audio data, and audio data needs to be processed, such as Fourier transform, variable, and windowing using Mel spectrogram [19]. Mel spectrogram is abbreviated as MFCC, and the MFCC coeﬃcient is determined by the mask phenomenon of diﬀerent wavelengths and frequencies that aﬀect the sensitivity of the human ear. Receive a simple signal by ﬁltering the water from low frequency to high frequency. Features ﬁt the body and face of the human ear, with good recognition [20]. The speech extraction process of MFCC is shown in Figure 2.
Using the Mel scale [21] to illustrate the characteristics of human physiological auditory frequency, the extracted parameters and the frequency formula are

To get the feature coeﬃcients of higher priority, further processing parameters are needed, and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to describe the spatial distribution of the linear prediction coeﬃcient cepstrum [20], and the formula expression of the style feature vector is obtained:

In the formula, p is the likelihood ratio, Xg is the style feature vector, f is the total number of frames contained in the music segment, kyðXgÞ is the probability function of the Gaussian component, and my is the weight of the y-th component.
There are two advantages to extracting vector values from audio data. (1) It avoids directly processing the original data, improves eﬃciency, and reduces the amount of complex data calculations. (2) The data features obtained are more accurate and obvious, and subsequent recommendations are more convenient [22].
The content-based recommendation system can establish a proﬁle that avoids complicated calculations and can describe music features. It has similar functions to feature vectors. Compared with the computing features of audio, content-based recommendation algorithms have greater advantages in text information and more mature [23].
2.2. Context-Based Recommendation Algorithm. Now is the society of the information age. Big data permeates all aspects of life everywhere. Users are also acquiring data while creating data. The closer the connection between them, the more relevant information generated over time. Context-based

recommendation algorithm is to mine the user’s behavior data to calculate its relevance for recommendation [24].
Collaborative ﬁltering recommendation algorithm is a relatively mature recommendation system at present. Once it is launched, it will play a role in various ﬁelds of the Internet. It is diﬀerent from content-based algorithm recommendation which requires calculation of a large number of complex audio data features. The algorithm process can be brieﬂy summarized into three steps: ﬁrst,
collecting users’ preferred behaviors and historical choice information and calculating the similarity degree between individual users’ information; then, evaluating and analyzing users’ behaviors and choices based on their similarity degree and deriving users’ potential choice behaviors relative to other users; and ﬁnally, recommending users based on their potential choice behaviors. For users with the same interest, the collaborative ﬁltering recommendation algorithm will use the average score of other users as the score of the unrated user. The disadvantage of this method is that it cannot take into account the diﬀerences between users. After further improvement, we must pay attention to the diﬀerences in preferences between diﬀerent users.
The collaborative ﬁltering recommendation algorithm is simply things and things and people and people. As shown in Figures 3 and 4, the calculation is based on the user and the item, respectively. These are all subcategories of general memory-based algorithms. Memory-based algorithms use known product rating information, the so-called “memory”
to guess user preferences or recommendations. Assume a collection of user A = fA1, A2,⋯,Ang. Then, B = fB1, B2,
⋯,Bmg is the product set. Let RAB be the user’s rating of the product. Given that Aa has a higher degree of similarity

preference, without the shortcomings of diﬀerent evaluation standards. In this way, the accuracy of formula (6) is higher.
The main research object of the context-based recommendation algorithm is the context, that is, all the information associated with music, and generally recommends music based on the user’s preference behavior and historical choices. Some scholars believe that social information based on the application content model, such as the similarity of art genres, emotional semantic space, and other contextual information, can describe the characteristics of music from the perspective of users. However, the public opinion information of popular music can cause chain problems of recommendation reactions.
The combination of contextual information and collaborative ﬁltering can expand the connection dimensions of the data collection and form and achieve more accurate personalized recommendations. Also, the concept of disproportionate sharing of consortia is always present in the data model. Not only will users be associated with data information, but users and data will also be associated with contextual information separately, so that contextual information can also be used as the basis of collaborative ﬁltering to evaluate the degree of similarity between users. Use this indirect link to recommend, even if there is no link between the user and the data; it can be evaluated through the contextual relationship between the user and the user.

2.3. Recommendation Algorithm Based on Neural Network Deep Learning. In the era of information big data facing a large amount of data information, with the development and application of artiﬁcial intelligence, it provides convenience for people in various situations in daily life, and the personalized intelligent recommendation system will provide eﬀective services in life. However, the construction of machine learning systems and model models is very diﬃcult.
Researchers have begun to look for other feature extraction methods to improve recommendation eﬃciency.
The deep learning proposed in recent years has brought new possibilities to machine learning. Unlike traditional machine learning, deep learning technology has been successful in the processing of computer vision and voice images. At this time, it has great performance in representation learning. The potential of deep learning, through suﬃcient combination changes, can simulate a perception process of the human brain and nervous system network the received external stimuli. Therefore, deep learning can be obtained through learning and adjustment through neural networks on the feature extraction model, rather than artiﬁcial design. Deep learning, a branch of machine learning, is an algorithm that attempts to perform high-level abstraction of data using multiple processing layers that contain complex structures or consist of multiple nonlinear transformations. The uniqueness of deep learning is that it allows multiple processing layers to be composed while the processing layer can be a traditional neural network or algorithms in other ﬁelds, as shown in Figure 5. Such a computing model can not only be extended but also learnt.
Currently, as one of the representative algorithms of deep learning, convolutional neural networks have achieved the best current results in computer vision, classiﬁcation,
and other ﬁelds. In a typical deep learning system, each neuron uses weights to “save” the acquired features, and in order better ﬁt external stimuli, nonlinear structure models are added to the original “memory unit” linear structure model.
For the linear activation function, the sigmoid function is often used as a typical activation function of neural networks, which can compress continuous values to (0,1).

neurons to a part of the input signal will deliberately ignore a large amount of complex information, thereby improving the learning accuracy. Sparsity has the ability to enhance the generalization ability of the network space and prevent overallocation, but excessive input will reduce the eﬀective capacity of the neural network model, resulting in too few eﬀective features for clear identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation.
At present, deep neural networks often use gradient descent methods for network optimization. Now, hot deep learning includes gradient descent algorithms. The implementation steps of gradient descent algorithms are as follows: (1) determine the learning rate; (2) given initial values; (3)) determine the downward direction and the reserved rate and update it; and (4) when the downward height is less than the deﬁned value or the iteration condition is reached, the descent will stop. The gradient descent method formula is as follows:

Equation (17) is the weight update process, and equation
(16) is the bias update process. θAðxÞ represents a simple linear regression model. jðA0, A1Þ is the loss function, used to evaluate the ﬁt between the output and the expectation,
m represents the training number set, and α is the learning rate. Convolutional neural networks will use parameter sharing, local cognition, pooling, and other methods to reduce the number of calculations. The convolution kernel and the image are only partially connected, rather than fully connected. Because the statistical properties of some parts of the

image are the same as others, the learned features of one part can also be used on another part. Therefore, the convolution kernel can share the same set of parameters in the process of convolving the input. After convolution, the feature will be further compressed through the pooling operation. Commonly used pooling operations include maximum pooling and average pooling. Convolutional neural network combines the advantages of image processing and deep learning.
It is a typical deep neural network, which can improve the accuracy of feature recognition and signiﬁcant neural calculations. This network is mostly used in image recognition and recommendation systems and is particularly suitable for processing image recognition and classiﬁcation.
2.4. Comparison of Recommendation Methods. This paper lists the content-based recommendation algorithm, the context-based collaborative ﬁltering algorithm, and the neural network-based recommendation algorithm, and the three algorithms are compared here.
The deep learning-based data processing is the same as the content-based one in that features are extracted from audio metadata. This approach avoids the cold start problem but increases the data processing burden. Therefore,
context-based recommendation algorithms such as collaborative ﬁltering are more popular in the industry, as they are easy to process and deploy, do not rely on metadata,
and keep up with users’ popular preferences. In addition,
the cold-start problem is a persistent problem in contextbased recommendation algorithms, where new users cannot be recommended if they do not generate information or have too little information.
Extracting music features from audio signals can essentially represent the genre to which the music belongs and is more relevant to human intuition about music. Contentbased and deep-learning-based recommendation algorithms have this advantage. However, due to the scalability of deep learning models, deep learning-based recommendation algorithms can be adapted to a wider range of platform environments and are highly scalable.

3. Music Recommendation Model Based on Convolutional Neural Network 3.1. CNN Training Process and Experimental Environment.
As shown in Figure 6, the general main process is divided into three parts: (1) the music data ﬁle is randomly divided into training samples and test samples, and the audio samples are segmented to generate spectrum data. (2) Compress the frequency spectrum data generated by the training sample processing and transfer it to neural network training. (3)
Finally, the neural network model is used for classiﬁcation and recommendation.
Due to various restrictions, the use of TensorFlow to train the model, the training state information comes from distributed machine learning, and execution on TensorFlow can simplify the creation, conﬁguration, training, evaluation,
and piloting of machine learning models. TensorFlow is easy to use. The training samples come from NetEase Cloud Music and Global Music Network. It was divided into four standard categories: classical, pop, rock, and pure music.
100 songs were selected for each, and then, random samples were selected. The music format was in mp3 format. The pixels of the divided spectrum segment are 128 × 128. Take 240 seconds of audio as a demonstration, broken down into about 93 fragments. The audio data was segmented, and more than 8,000 image samples were obtained from the frag-

ments. 40% of the images are used as training examples, 30%
are used as images, and 30% are used as measurement models.
The sample image is represented in grayscale, the x-axis represents time, the y-axis represents frequency, the grayscale represents the amplitude of frequency 29, and the free region (i.e.,, the larger the gray value) has higher amplitude.
Figure 7 shows four typical spectrum images. Each atlas represents a piece of music. From the atlas, you can see that the overall range of the “light music” gray scale is weak and the music is calm. The “classic” frequencies are high and the backs of the gray scale more intense, indicating relatively high notes and strong rhythms. The change in the width of the “rock” gray scale is particularly noticeable and atherosclerosis is bright. The frequency of “bursts” is usually low,
the weaknesses are equal, and the sense of unity is strong.
After many adjustments in experiments, based on the classic convolutional neural network model, the ﬁnal model is shown in Figure 8.
The model has 4 convolution+pooling layers, the neural network has 1024 neurons, and it uses fully connected training.
This experiment refers to other excellent experimental schemes of deep neural networks, namely, the back propagation algorithm of neural networks. BP multilayer perception algorithm is explored in relation to focusing on the study

3.2. Comparison and Analysis of Activation Functions. After comparing multiple sets of activation functions, this article focuses on the comparison of ELU and ReLU activation functions. First, it is the most widely used ReLU, whose activation equation is ið f Þ = max ð0, wf + aÞ:

ð18Þ

The ReLU activation functions because the derivative is a constant, so the calculation is very small, so the calculation is

very eﬃcient. Also because the derivative is constant, the error can move smoothly in the entire range, and there is no problem of gradient disappearance and gradient explosion. Also, the output portion of the neuron is set to 0. This improves network diﬀerences and at the same time reduces parameter dependencies. However, if the learning rate of the ReLU activation function is not set reasonably, and there happens to be a large gradient at this time, the neuron will be
“paralyzed” at this time. The real-time performance is that the gradient of the neuron is displayed as 0 and no longer changes, so that the neural network no longer has the learning ability. In general, “paralysis” is only an individual phenomenon, not the whole, and has no eﬀect on the entire network.

if f > 0,

αðexp ð f Þ − 1, if f ≤ 0:

ð19Þ

Compared with the ReLU activation function, the ELU activation function can take a negative value, which can make the average unit activation close to zero, reducing the amount of calculation while reducing the deviation value.
The ELU mitigates the gradient dispersion problem to a certain extent and has a soft saturation property for small values of the input, which improves the robustness to noise.
3.3. Comparative Analysis of Optimized Control Modules.
The optimal solution obtained by batch gradient descent
(BGD) is the global optimal solution, but the process is particularly time-consuming because all the data in the training set are called for each training iteration, and the sample training speed is severely reduced if the number of samples is large.
The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) iterative training method draws only one batch of samples to update the parameters. Considering a single sample, the loss function corresponds to the granularity of each sample in the training set.
Compared with the batch descent method, the stochastic gradient descent method has a faster descent speed and has a good learning convergence eﬀect under a large number of sample data. However, the gradient change in the stochastic gradient descent method only comes from the random part and cannot be considered as a whole. This also means that there is a gradient error, which will aﬀect the irregular changes in the next iteration of the gradient descent. The iteration process is as follows:

where p represents the attenuation rate, represents thê

Plus the RMSProp algorithm can realize the automatic change of the learning rate. If the value of the gradient descent this time is relatively large, the decomposition of the learning rate needs to be accelerated; similarly, when

The other Adam, which also uses an adaptive learning rate method, is an optimizer based on the RMSProp algorithm. The average of the historical gradient ui is mi = β1mi − 1 + ð1 − β1Þ ̂

In this, mi represents the weight of the mean slope value and ui represents the weight equal to it. β1 and β2 are inefﬁcient, but if the measure is still close to 1, mi and ui will be close to 0. The equation is mi =

Adam can further modify the RMSProp result, which is equivalent to adding another pulse compensation. Whether it is descent speed or accuracy, Adam’s perfect controller is excellent.

4. Combining User Preference Characteristic System Experimental Model and Its Analysis Results 4.1. User Preference Feature Calculation. By combining the relationship between music and distribution and the relationship between music and users, you can obtain the relationship between users and the characteristics of distribution. Suppose that the relationship between a certain user and multiple pieces of music is Su, a = ½a1, a2, a3 ⋯ am
, and the optimization result of music classiﬁcation is Ca, b
= ½½b11, b12, b13 ⋯ b1n, ½b21, b22, b23 ⋯ b2n ⋯ ½bm1, bm 2, bm3 ⋯ bmn, where Sj represents the degree of preference for a certain piece of music, ½bi1, bi2, bi3 ⋯ bin is the classiﬁcation feature vector of a certain music, and the others are 0. When only three ratio values are not 0, the relationship of user preferences is qu, c = Ca, bt × Su, at ,

4.2. Similarity Analysis Combined with User Preference Features. When using the angular cosine method in this experiment, we found some problems that are not suitable for this research. But when the sample characteristics A1 =
f0, 0, 0, 0:8g and A2 = f0, 0, 0, 0:9g and the user feature P

= f0, 0, 0, 1g, the cosine calculation results are all 1. This is because cosine only calculates the included angle, and there is no comparison of vector lengths. In order to correct this problem, a vector ratio is added to the cosine:

Among them, A is the distribution feature vector of some music,A is the relationship vector between the user and the distribution, and it is the similarity betweenA and P.
The three values in Figure 9 above are the cosine angle,
ZA, P, and Euclidean distance in sequence. The smaller the value, the higher the similarity.
This experiment introduces Euclidean distance as a reference, and it is a random sample of 10 categorical variables,
and the cosine and ZA, P similarity are calculated separately.

The results showed that ZA, P can reﬂect the diﬀerence of classiﬁcation characteristics; on the other hand, the diﬀerence of energy body value is close to the value of current Euclidean distance. But adding the same ZA, P to the modulus ratio reduces the similarity.
4.3. Comprehensive Evaluation and Multicategory Evaluation of User Characteristics. If the qu, c user only likes a piece of music, the user only has a one-dimensional vector image and can instantly trust the similarity between the vector image and ﬁle function. If the user likes some songs, the qu, c user represents the number of feature vectors. You can get the qu, c by calculating the average overlay eﬀect on feature vectors. This may indicate that the user likes the full feature. This is a guide. It also supports the analysis of user characteristics and the calculation of similarity. The formula is quc = quc/m:

ð33Þ

Suppose the classiﬁcation features of the music you listen to are {0.8,0,0,0} and {0,0.9,0,0}; then, qu, c = f0:4, 0:45, 0, 0g

. User preferences are all single categories, and qu, c as the basis is indeed multicategory. A single pair of user preferences is not reasonable but should be recommended in categories. Based on the selection of music data, only two categories are considered in this paper, i.e., single category and double category, plus “other,” for a total of 11 category distributions. If more music data were available, the category distribution could be larger. However, the research in this paper considers the short-term behavior of users, and users do not switch between multiple music genres in a short period of time. Therefore, the data of multiple categories are less.
The data sample of this experiment is 100 pieces of music. After the trained convolutional neural network model predicts the classiﬁcation, 1000 classiﬁcation features are obtained, and the classiﬁcation is optimized. In this paper, the user’s music list is obtained based on the hidden Markov’s music classiﬁcation model, such as formula (32),
10 songs for each user, as a reference for the results.
Xt + 1 = Xt × Phmm:

As shown in Table 1, if the education distribution status is irreversible, it is the previous music distribution, the next one obtained after guessing, the music ﬁle distribution is compared to the music ﬁle distribution function, and the similarity is that I have. It has the following name.
In the recommendation method experiment combining the comprehensive evaluation of user characteristics, the article ﬁrst calculates the mean value qu, c of the user’s preference characteristics, as shown in Figure 10, to calculate the degree of ZA, P similarity. Randomly select 10 of which are less than 0.1 for recommendation. qu, c is the average characteristic of users. The recommended results of the user’s comprehensive evaluation are as follows.
The y2 and y8 in Figure 10 belong to users with multiple categories, and the average hit rate is 50.35% through calculation. Experiments show that the recommendation accuracy rate of a single category in the average feature preference set

is higher than that of users with multiple categories, which may be the selected sample less, so the probability of randomness should be smaller. Of course, it is also possible that

the user prefers a single category. It can be seen that the characteristics of preference are not very accurate.
The multicategory evaluation results of user characteristics are shown in Table 2.
The average hit rate calculated from Table 2 is 42.89%,
and users y5 and y9 in the table are multicategory users.
Because the results of multicategory similarity calculations are too large, this paper sets the similarity threshold to 0.15. The empirical results show that the recommendation rate of multicategory recommendation is generally lower than that of average feature, but average feature is better for multicategory users, because multicategory classiﬁcation avoids a single expression of average feature.
The comparison of the recommendation results of the two recommendation methods for diﬀerent user types is shown in Figure 11: (1) is a general evaluation of user characteristics and (2) is a comprehensive evaluation of user characteristics.

From the comparison in Figure 11, it turns out that the method of measuring user characteristics is generally better than the consent of diﬀerent types of measurements. For an individual user, the process of generally evaluating user characteristics is superior to the process of approving multiple groups of user characteristics. The result is good. However, for multiuser groups, measurements of diﬀerent types of user attributes are better than the recommended measurements.
In this experiment, it is found that diﬀerent similarity thresholds have a signiﬁcant impact on the multicategory evaluation recommendation method of user characteristics.
When the maximum proportion of a piece of music exceeds the threshold, the music is considered as a single classiﬁcation and the classiﬁcation is based on the result of the voting method; if the maximum proportion is less than the threshold, the music is considered to contain multiple classiﬁcation features. In this way, the predicted classiﬁcation results of the CNN are divided by the threshold, and two results are obtained more accurately: one is a single classiﬁcation, and the other is a multiple classiﬁcation. Regardless of the classiﬁcation result, it can be expressed as the music classiﬁcation feature vector. The recommendation results under diﬀerent thresholds are listed in Figure 12.
The user sample in Figure 12 uses the user characteristics of Table 2. From the graph results, when the similarity threshold is 0.1 or 0.15, the probability of multicategory users y5 and y9 is lower, but the similarity threshold is at 0.2; the recommendation accuracy rate of multicategory users y5 and y9 is much higher than the probability of the comprehensive recommendation evaluation method, indicating that its accuracy rate has improved. But for a single category, if the similarity threshold is too large, the accuracy will decrease. Therefore, the intermediate value 0.15 is the equilibrium result of the experiment.
In general, it turns out that measuring user characteristics is better than approving diﬀerent types of measurements. For a single user, this process usually measures user characteristics better than the multiuser recognition process.
The result is good. However, for many user groups, measurements for diﬀerent behavioral uses are better than the recommended measurements. In addition to music preferences, users’ behavior preferences should also involve users’
personal information, search records, favorites lists, etc.
Compared with the traditional content-based music recommendation method, this paper uses the convolutional neural network classiﬁcation model to obtain the feature vector of music, which simpliﬁes the processing of massive audio data and the complex audio feature extraction process. The user characteristics are also considered in the recommendation process. diﬀerence. However, the method of musical note recognition is currently more suitable for pure music recommendation.
The content-based convolutional neural network recommendation algorithm also uses audio feature training, but diﬀerent from this method is that based on the content, a large number of user scores are required to predict the popularity of music, and then, recommendations are based on the popularity. This article compares the recommended

13 accuracy rates under diﬀerent scoring ratios as shown in Figure 13.
It can be seen from the results that the recommendation algorithm based on the content-based convolutional neural network that relies on user evaluation data has a low recommendation accuracy rate during cold start, but the recommendation accuracy rate begins to increase when user evaluation data is added. Since the method in this paper does not rely on user scoring, the accuracy of recommendation does not change much. Therefore, this method has certain use value in the absence of user scoring data for recommendation.

5. Conclusions During the analysis, this task ﬁnds data and classiﬁcation errors in the content delivery and advises the model to optimize them. The results can be used as a vector representation of the distribution of music features and can be combined with music user settings to calculate the user experience. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of user characteristics and suggestions for measuring diﬀerent types of user characteristics based on the process of calculating diﬀerences in characteristics and compares the two methods. Experimental results show that a good rationale for a user-suggested group is the extensive evaluation of user features, and the logic for various user feature metrics is appropriate for approving multiple user groups. On the whole, the recommendation result of comprehensive evaluation of user characteristics is better than recommendation results of multicategory evaluation of user characteristics.
This paper proposes two recommendation methods based on user preference characteristics. The experimental results show that the two recommendation methods can achieve better recommendation results. In the recommendation method of comprehensive evaluation of user characteristics,
the recommendation accuracy rate of single-category user characteristics is higher than that of multicategory user characteristics, with an average accuracy rate of 50.35%, while in the recommendation method of multicategory evaluation of user characteristics, the accuracy of feature recommendation of multicategory users is higher than that of single-category user features, with an average accuracy of 42.89%. Comparing the results of the content-based convolutional neural network recommendation algorithm shows that although the recommendation accuracy rate of this method is not high, it has certain advantages in cold start and can also have better recommendation results.
