Abstract

1

Music is a medium that connects cultures, expresses emotions,
and can create memory connections that are deeply embedded in people’s hearts. With the rapid expansion of digital music platforms,
providing an effective personalized recommendation system that helps users browse huge song libraries can effectively promote platform usage. However, existing music recommendation systems usually fail to fully capture individual preferences. In this study,
we aim to address these limitations by developing an advanced recommendation system focusing on two facets: 1) building a model for music genre classification, and 2) providing a platform with personalized recommendations based on user preferences. We herein integrate three models for music genre classification, transfer learning, convolutional neural networks, and gated recurrent units
(TL + CNN + GRU), using the GTZAN dataset. Results show that the TL + CNN + GRU model can improve the accuracy (55%->71%)
of personalized music recommendation systems by using 10-fold cross-validation. Finally, we introduce a prototype platform for understanding user experience. In conclusion, our model not only improves the accuracy of recommendations, but also promotes user exposure to different music genres, redefining the user experience.

Music is a universal cultural and emotional expression deeply embedded in human existence. The rise of digital music services has given users access to vast libraries of songs, enabling the modern musical experience to be both diverse and personalized. However,
the sheer number of song choices often leads to information overload, making it difficult for users to find music that matches their preferences. This challenge underscores the need for effective music recommendation systems that elevate the user experience through personalized suggestions and introduction to new music. For modern music consumers, streaming platforms offer convenient, instant access to music, but users often struggle to find specific styles that match their preferences.
Music Recommendation Systems (MRS) are a topic of interest in the field of personalized digital services. Chen et al. [1] introduced an MRS that focuses on providing personalized music recommendations based on user interests. Building on this concept, this team then developed a system that determines representative tracks of polyphonic music objects and extracts features for proper music grouping to enhance the recommendation process [2]. Park et al. [3] proposed a Context-Aware Music Recommendation System
(CA-MRS) that utilizes fuzzy systems, Bayesian networks, and utility theory to recommend appropriate music based on the context.
Similarly, Lee et al. [4] developed a system called C2_Music that incorporates user demographics, behavioral patterns, and context to better recommend music that users listened to in similar contexts.
Han et al. [5] contributed to the idea of context awareness in music recommendation by using a support vector machine (SVM) as an emotional state transition classifier, while Wang et al. [6] presented a hybrid method that integrates deep learning features with collaborative filtering to improve the performance of content-based and hybrid music recommendation systems. Moreover, Rosa et al.
[7] focused on extracting user sentiment from social networks to recommend songs, while Ayata et al. [8] proposed an emotionbased music recommendation framework that learns user emotions from signals obtained via wearable physiological sensors. Finally,
Abdul et al. [9] introduced an Emotion-Aware Personalized Music Recommendation System using Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) to enhance the recommendation process based on user emotions. Despite attention by multiple research teams, modern music recommendation systems still struggle to deliver music that aligns with user preference.
Music genre classification plays a crucial role in personalized music recommendation systems, as user preferences are often linked to specific genres. The GTZAN dataset, a well-known collection

Introduction

AICCC 2024, December 14–16, 2024, Tokyo, Japan

Pei-Chun Lin et al.

of music pre-classified by genre, has been widely utilized in machine learning research on music genre recognition (MGR) [10].
Research in music information retrieval (MIR) has explored various areas, including MGR and music emotion recognition [11].
Advances in neural network training have enabled more efficient representation learning from raw audio data, enhancing feature extraction for audio analysis [12]. Deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been applied to MIR tasks, including genre recognition, by using spectrogram images for classification [13]. Additionally, sparse dictionaries have been employed in music-speech classification, where learned coefficients help distinguish between music and speech in datasets like GTZAN
[14].
Other approaches to genre classification include a feature extraction method called DWCHs for music genre classification developed by Li et al. [15]. A later study by this team explored the use of taxonomy for music genre classification and proposed an approach for automatically generating genre taxonomies based on confusion matrices [16]. Silla et al. [17] presented a novel approach to automatic music genre classification using multiple feature vectors and an ensemble of classifiers. Their experiments on a large Latin music dataset showed that features extracted from the middle part of the songs yielded better results than segments from the beginning or end. Lim et al. [18] developed an automatic classification system for music genres using a combined super-vector with a Decorrelated Filter Bank (DFB) and Octave-based Spectral Contrast (OSC)
processed by a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Markov et al. [19]
investigated the feasibility of Gaussian Processes (GPs) for music genre classification and music emotion estimation. Panagakis et al. [20] proposed a joint sparse low-rank representation (JSLRR)
framework for music genre classification, which smooths noise in test samples and identifies the subspaces in which the test samples lie. Corrêa et al. [21] conducted a survey on symbolic data-based music genre classification. More recent studies have focused on deep learning techniques for music genre classification. Oramas et al. [22] explored multimodal deep learning for this task, while Bahuleyan [23] compared the performance of different machine learning models. Finally, Yu et al. [24] explored a deep attentionbased approach to the task of music genre classification.

where a filter or kernel slides across the image, computing local point products to create feature maps. This is followed by pooling,
which reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps and makes the model more robust to changes in the data’s position. After feature extraction, the classification phase begins. The feature maps are flattened into one-dimensional vectors and passed through one or more fully connected layers. In these layers, each neuron is connected to all the activation functions from the previous layer,
enabling the model to map the extracted features to the final class labels. The final layer, known as the output layer, typically uses a SoftMax function to assign predictive probabilities to each class.
In music-related tasks, CNNs have proven effective at capturing audio features. For example, Rai [25] used the GTZAN dataset, extracting 100 audio files for spectrum preprocessing and classifying music using a CNN model. Similarly, research by Puppala et al. [26]
and Zhang & Wu [27] applied CNNs to process spectral features for music genre classification. CNNs excel in music applications by efficiently identifying patterns in audio data, enabling superior performance in tasks such as music style classification and sentiment analysis. By training CNN models to recognize various music styles, researchers can effectively classify a wide range of music genres.

2.2

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

The following is an overview of the dataset, models, and related theories used in this study. First, model architectures such as CNNs and GRUs are introduced. Next, the concepts of transfer learning
(TL) and 10-Fold Cross-Validation (10-FCV) are explained. By detailing these methodological components, Section 2 sets the stage for understanding the empirical findings presented later in the study and their implications for the field of music recommendation systems.

2.1

Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a recurrent neural network architecture similar to the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network,
designed to address the vanishing gradient problem in standard RNNs. GRUs incorporate memory and gating mechanisms like those in LSTMs but with a simplified structure, reducing the number of parameters. Despite this streamlined design, GRUs often perform comparably to LSTMs, providing an efficient alternative with similar capabilities. Both LSTMs and GRUs capture long-term dependencies effectively and mitigate issues like the vanishing gradient problem. Studies using LSTMs have demonstrated improved accuracy in music genre classification by processing sequential features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR) ([28]-[31]).
A GRU Model operates through two key components: the update gate and the reset gate [32]. These gates control the flow of information, enabling selective forgetting and updating within the model.
The reset gate determines how much past information should be forgotten by considering the current input X_t and the previous hidden state h_(t-1) , and outputs a value through the activation function 𝜎. The update gate, which uses a similar process, decides how much of the past information should be retained. A new candidate hidden state is generated by combining the previous hidden state h_(t-1) , scaled by the reset gate (indicating discarded information), with the current input X_t, passed through an activation function such as tanh. The final hidden state h_t is then produced by balancing the old hidden state h_(t-1) with the new candidate hidden state h_t, updated by the update gate.
Sukanda & Adytia [33] used a GRU model to predict wave heights in Indonesia, leveraging significant wave height data from 2014 to 2021 to support marine activities, including ship navigation, maintenance, and offshore engineering. Similarly, Kuan et al. [34] applied a GRU model for short-term power load forecasting, addressing the

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in deep learning, especially for image recognition tasks. These models generally consist of two main components: feature extraction and classification. In the feature extraction phase, the input image
(either grayscale or RGB) is passed through a convolutional layer,

exploding and vanishing gradient issues with a Scaled Exponential Linear Unit (SELU) activation function. Their findings showed that the GRU architecture provided more accurate predictions than other RNNs. Extending GRU applications to music data, Zhang et al.
[35] introduced an approach combining a Residual Neural Network
(ResNet) with GRU, using visual spectrum data as input to enhance genre classification and improve music recommendation systems.
Although GRU models are efficient and require fewer parameters than standard RNNs, they may encounter challenges with longer sequences or complex melodies, where other models might perform better. GRUs improve temporal data modeling by simplifying the LSTM architecture while retaining strong performance, making them well-suited for applications like music analysis.

the model from being overly tuned to a particular subset of data and ensures a comprehensive evaluation by utilizing all data points for both training and validation [40]. For example, in the paper by Song et. al. [41], the researchers utilized the average accuracy of 10-fold cross-checks in the final test of their model. They chose to use 1 out of all 10 folds for testing and the other folds for training. Following their method, the accuracy increased from 93.5% to 95.8%. Therefore, in our music recommendation system, 10-FCV is employed to improve model generalizability, leading to more accurate predictions across different genres.

MODEL DESIGN AND TRAINING

This section delineates the methodology employed in the development of our genre-specific music recommendation system. It provides a comprehensive overview of the experimental design,
encompassing the system architecture, data collection processes,
preprocessing techniques, and model design considerations.

Transfer Learning (TL)

Transfer Learning (TL) significantly enhances model performance by transferring knowledge from pre-trained tasks to new tasks,
which is particularly beneficial in scenarios where labeled data is scarce ([36], [37]). This technique capitalizes on the rich features learned by deep neural networks during their training on large datasets, allowing them to apply this acquired knowledge to different but related tasks. In practical applications, TL often involves re-purposing pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) models, such as VGG, ResNet, or Inception, which have been trained on extensive image datasets like ImageNet. By freezing the convolutional layers of these models and fine-tuning only the classifier on the new task, practitioners can achieve significantly faster training times and improved accuracy. This is especially advantageous for complex tasks like music genre classification, where the feature extraction process is computationally expensive. For instance, the MobileNet model [38], which is designed for efficiency and speed, has demonstrated remarkable improvements in classification performance when applied to the Magna-tag-a-tune [39].
Additionally, TL not only reduces the amount of data needed for training but also helps mitigate the risk of overfitting, which is a common concern when training models from scratch on limited datasets. This approach enables researchers and practitioners to leverage pre-existing knowledge, resulting in models that can generalize better to unseen data. As a result, TL has emerged as a vital strategy in various domains, including computer vision and audio analysis, paving the way for more robust and reliable AI systems.

3.1

Data Collection

To train our music recommendation model, we utilized the wellestablished GTZAN dataset [42], which comprises 1,000 songs distributed across ten distinct genres: blues, classical, country, disco,
hip hop, jazz, metal, rock, reggae, and pop, with 100 songs allocated to each genre. These tracks were sourced from CDs, radio broadcasts, and personal recordings made between 2000 and 2001. Each track has a duration of 30 seconds and is stored in .wav format.
3.1.1 Spectrogram Generation. To facilitate the analysis of audio data within the system, we employed the librosa Python library to convert audio signals into spectrograms. Initially, the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) was utilized to transform the time-domain representation of the audio into a frequency-domain spectrogram, thereby capturing time-frequency variations. Subsequently, the spectrogram was converted to a decibel scale to provide a more visually interpretable representation of signal energy.
3.1.2 Data Preprocessing. The spectrograms were processed and resized to dimensions of 256×256×3, where the values represent the height, width, and RGB channels, respectively. These formatted images served as input data for the model training process.

3.2

TL + CNN + GRU Model

Previous research [43] has shown that combining Transfer Learning
(TL) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) improves genre classification using the GTZAN dataset. However, while the TL +
CNN model achieved a respectable F1 score of 0.53, its accuracy
(52%) was suboptimal. To address this, we propose a TL + CNN
+ GRU model, leveraging the strengths of both CNNs for spatial feature extraction and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for capturing temporal information. While this approach increases model complexity, careful parameter tuning mitigates overfitting risks.

10-Fold Cross Validation (10-FCV)

10-fold cross-validation (10-FCV) is a widely used technique for evaluating machine learning models, especially when the training data is limited. The 10-FCV is a case of the commonly used technique of k-fold cross-validation that emerged as a general statistical and machine learning method from the fields of statistical resampling and experimental design over the 20th century. When k=10,
the dataset is divided into ten equal parts, or folds. The model is trained on nine of the folds, while the remaining fold is used for testing. This process is repeated ten times, with each fold serving as the test set once, ensuring that every data point is used for both training and testing. The results from all ten iterations are averaged to provide a reliable and comprehensive estimate of the model’s performance. This method helps reduce overfitting, as it prevents

3.2.1 Model Architecture. Our TL + CNN + GRU model consists of several key layers:
• Input Layer: Accepts input images of shape (256, 256, 3).
• MobileNetV2: A pre-trained model for feature extraction,
outputting a feature map of shape (8, 8, 1280).

of which 5,521,418 are trainable, while 2,257,984 are non-trainable,
originating from the pre-trained weights of MobileNetV2.
3.2.2 10-Fold Cross-Validation (10-FCV). We implemented 10-Fold Cross-Validation (10-FCV) to enhance model performance and mitigate the risk of overfitting. This methodology guarantees that each data sample is utilized for both training and validation, thereby maximizing the utilization of the dataset. By systematically partitioning the data into ten subsets, the model is trained and validated across multiple iterations, ensuring a robust evaluation of its generalization capabilities.
Following the implementation of 10-Fold Cross-Validation (10FCV), our Transfer Learning (TL) combined with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model achieved a notable accuracy of 71%. Furthermore, the F1-scores

We summarize it in Table 1.
The architecture of the model commences with an input layer designed to accept images of size 256×256 with three channels
(RGB). Following this, the MobileNetV2 layer extracts spatial features from the input data, which are subsequently processed by a Global Average Pooling layer that reduces the dimensionality of the feature map. A Reshape layer then adjusts the output to facilitate sequential processing by the Simple RNN layer, enabling the capture of temporal information. After the output is flattened, a Dense layer is employed to perform the final classification into ten distinct

for genre classification exhibited improvements across all genres,
except the pop genre. The analysis of the confusion matrix indicated a more balanced classification performance, while the validation loss demonstrated consistent improvement without any abrupt fluctuations. These results further underscore the effectiveness of the 10-FCV approach in enhancing model performance.
The results presented in Table 2 demonstrate the performance of different model architectures for genre classification in music recommendation systems. The models compared include a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with Transfer Learning (TL), a model that adds Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and a final version that incorporates 10-Fold Cross-Validation (10-FCV)
into the TL + CNN + GRU framework. Across various genres, the addition of GRUs consistently enhances the classification accuracy,
although not uniformly across all genres. For instance, while the accuracy for classical music is notably high, reaching 0.88 with TL
+ CNN and improving to 0.92 with the addition of 10-FCV, genres

like rock show more erratic results, dropping from 0.26 to 0.04 with the GRU model. However, the inclusion of 10-FCV generally improves performance across most genres, particularly blues, which increases from 0.49 to 0.74. The overall model accuracy improves from 0.53 with TL + CNN to 0.71 with TL + CNN + GRU + 10FCV, indicating that the hybrid approach is effective in refining the classification process. These results highlight the importance of model complexity and validation techniques in achieving more accurate genre classifications in music recommendation systems.

NOVEL RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

Following the development of the TL + CNN + GRU + 10-FCV model,
we implemented it to create a genre-based music recommendation system. This system enables users to upload audio files in various formats, including MP3, WAV, or FLAC, to query the genre and receive recommendations for similar music. Users can submit their

Based on this genre classification, the system generates recommendations for songs with similar genres sourced from platforms such as YouTube and Spotify. Figure 4 illustrates the overall architecture of the music recommendation system.
Once a user uploads a song through the web interface, they have the option to filter their search further by selecting a preferred language (English, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, or Russian)
and specifying a time range (within a week, month, or year) for songs uploaded to YouTube and Spotify. Upon receiving the audio file, the backend system employs the TL + CNN + GRU + 10-FCV model to predict the genre of the uploaded song. Subsequently, the system provides recommendations for similar music based on the predicted genre from both YouTube and Spotify.

CONCLUSIONS

This study introduces a novel approach to developing a personalized music recommendation system that integrates Transfer Learning
(TL), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), further enhanced by the implementation of 10-Fold Cross-Validation (10-FCV). The incorporation of 10-FCV significantly enhances the model’s performance by mitigating overfitting and optimizing genre classification accuracy, particularly for underrepresented genres such as classical and jazz. Our system effectively analyzes user-uploaded music files, accurately identifies their genres, and recommends similar tracks from platforms like YouTube and Spotify, thus delivering personalized music recommendations.
Despite encountering challenges related to data imbalance and the intricacies of combining CNN and GRU, the model exhibits substantial improvements in genre prediction accuracy when compared to previous methodologies. Future research will aim to expand the dataset, integrate additional musical features, and refine the model to enhance both speed and accuracy for real-time recommendations, ultimately enriching user experiences through more precise and tailored music suggestions.
