We present the results of a 12-week longitudinal user study wherein the participants, 110 subjects from
Southern Europe, received on a daily basis Electronic Music (EM) diversified recommendations. By analyzing
their explicit and implicit feedback, we show that exposure to specific levels of music recommendation diversity
may be responsible for long-term impacts on listeners’ attitudes. In particular, we highlight the function of
diversity in increasing the openness in listening to EM, a music genre not particularly known or liked by the
participants previous to their participation in the study. Moreover, we demonstrate that recommendations may
help listeners in removing positive and negative attachments towards EM, deconstructing pre-existing implicit
associations but also stereotypes associated with this music. In addition, our results show the significant clout
that recommendation diversity has in generating curiosity in listeners.

INTRODUCTION

Recommender Systems (RS) affect several choices in our daily life, helping us choose, for instance,
the news we read, the movies we watch, the job positions we apply for, or the music we listen to.
Besides the end-users consuming the recommendations, RS also affect those producing the items
being recommended: artists’ royalty revenues may depend on whether they are recommended or
not within a streaming platform; the fame of a brand in e-commerce may rely upon if its products
are displayed or not as similar to the ones previously purchased by users; the time spent unemployed
may depend on whether a profile is shown or not to potential employers. These are just a few
examples of the several RS stakeholders subject to different, sometimes unintended, and emerging
impacts [43].
The awareness of these impacts is at the basis of the flourishing fair ranking and recommendations literature [75]. For instance, Hasan et al. [36] show that RS potentially increases excessive
video usage on online platforms. Adomavicius et al. [1] highlight the role of recommendations in
manipulating consumers’ preference ratings. Fabbri et al. [21] investigate the role of RS in promoting
users’ radicalization. Notwithstanding, RS may certainly be responsible also for positive changes.
Hauptmann et al. [37] propose an app for healthy food recommendations that positively affect
nutritional behaviour. Music recommendations have been used for helping recover the musical
memory of people with Alzheimer’s disease [70]. In the work by Starke et al. [88] users’ adoption
of energy-saving measures is boosted thanks to a proper recommendation interface design. Other
examples are provided in the comprehensive overview of RS stakeholders, values, and risks by
Jannach and Bauer [41].
Among the recommendation characteristics under the spotlight in RS impact-oriented research,
diversity has drawn the interest of researchers, practitioners, policy-makers and also affected
communities because of its latent influence on individuals’ choices. In particular, exposure diversity as
mediated by recommender systems is a research topic attracting scholars from different disciplines,

especially in relation to its impact on human rights such as inclusion, non-discrimination and
fairness [39]. Previous works in the RS literature have investigated how recommendations may
influence aspects such as consumption or sales diversity, sometimes focusing on the impact of
diversity on other recommendation characteristics, such as their usefulness or attractiveness e.g.,
[101]. Nevertheless, in this strain of RS research longitudinal user studies are still quite rare.
We contribute to this latter corpus of research with this work, the first longitudinal user study
in the Music RS literature presenting an impact analysis of diversity on listeners’ attitudes. It
consists of a 12-week study wherein the participants, 110 subjects from Southern Europe, received
daily Electronic Music (EM) recommendations with different levels of diversity. We propose a
critical evaluation that takes into account insights from the music psychology and education field.
Indeed, music exposure is proven to have the power of reducing stereotypes and prejudice against
unknown or unfamiliar cultures. In addition, repeated exposure and familiarity have been linked to
the construction of aesthetic preferences in the music domain. Under this lens, we evaluate the
impact of recommendation diversity not from a behavioural perspective but instead assessing how
music recommendations may be a vehicle for attitudinal change. Specifically, the purpose of this
study is to answer the following research questions:
[RQ1] to what extent listeners’ implicit and explicit attitudes towards an unfamiliar music
genre can be affected by exposure to music recommendations?
[RQ2] what is the relationship between music recommendation diversity and the impact
on listeners’ attitudes?
By analyzing participants’ explicit and implicit feedback, we show that exposure to specific levels
of music recommendation diversity may be responsible for long-term impacts on listeners’ attitudes.
In particular, we highlight the function of diversity in increasing the openness in listening to EM,
a music genre not particularly known or liked by the participants previous to their participation
in the study. Moreover, we demonstrate that recommendations may help listeners in removing
positive and negative attachments towards EM, deconstructing pre-existing implicit associations
but also stereotypes associated with this music. In addition, our results show the significant clout
that recommendation diversity has in generating curiosity in listeners.
The rest of the article is organised as follows. Section 2 starts with an overview of impact
assessment practices, followed by a brief survey of recent developments of RS simulation-based
methods, and lastly presents several works on the impact of music exposure on listeners. Afterwards,
Section 3 describes the user study design, while Section 4 reports the process designed to create the
music recommendation to which study participants have been exposed. Then, Section 5 presents
the results of our analysis, discussed together with their limitations in Section 6. Finally, conclusions
are drawn in Section 7.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK

Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA) is a complex process that goes beyond the development of
practices to measure quantitatively some kind of change. Instead, it includes the involvement of
several actors, starting from the system designers arriving at the community affected by algorithmic
systems. In Section 2.1, we discuss the idea of impact and impact assessment, in particular with regard
to recent proposals of AIA. Afterwards, in Section 2.2 we centre our attention on RS simulationbased frameworks, which have attracted the attention of the practitioners interested in assessing
the impact of these systems. On the contrary, as recently observed by Liang and Willemsen [59],
longitudinal studies are not common in RS literature and their recent work is a notable exception,
together with the study presented by Hauptmann et al. [37]. Finally, in Section 2.3 we present
several insights from the music psychology field on the impact of music exposure on listeners.

Algorithmic Impact Assessment

In its simplest form, Impact Assessment (IA) may be defined as “[...] the process of identifying the
future consequences of a current or proposed action. The impact is the difference between what
would happen with the action and what would happen without it” [40]. Far from being a novel area
of research, IA practices have been discussed globally since 1980 by the International Association
for Impact Assessment (IAIA),1 and justifiably one among the first framework proposed in this
regard is the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). During the last 40 years, EIA had to deal with
issues associated with loss of biodiversity, damage to marine areas, and climate change, just to
mention a few [67].
At the same time the second strain of IA practices has emerged to monitor socio-cultural impacts,
among the others Social (and Societal) Impact Assessment (SIA) [54, 95, 96], Human Rights Impact
Assessment (HRIA) [49], and Cultural Impact Assessment (CIA) [74]. Vanclay [95] defines SIA as
“analysing, monitoring and managing the social consequences of development”, wherein a particular
focus is posed on values such as fairness and equity, commitment to sustainability, or openness
and accountability [96]. Similarly, Societal Impact Assessment targets technology as potentially
responsible for altering society as a whole, and Kreissl et al. [54] exemplify this framework by
discussing the case of Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). Instead, HRIA is based on a series of
internationally recognised human rights, such as the right to a livelihood, the right to participate
in the cultural life of a community, or the right to a fair wage [49].
Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA) is relatively a new field in comparison to the aforementioned frameworks, but nevertheless, its importance is quickly growing. Despite its relations with
other IA such as Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) or Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
[46], AIA can be defined as a set of “emerging governance practices for delineating accountability,
rendering visible the harms caused by algorithmic systems, and ensuring practical steps are taken
to ameliorate those harms” [65]. A few aspects of AIA are addressed in detail below, but we point
the reader interested in a comprehensive overview and discussion on current AIA practices towards
the reports published by the non-profit organisations AI Now Institute [80] and Data & Society [69].
As discussed by Vecchione et al. [97] in the context of algorithmic auditing, most of the impact
which may result from the interaction with an algorithmic system appears beyond discrete moments
of decision-making. This is particularly true for RS, wherein the impact may not be evident after a
single interaction, but instead be the fruit of multiple exposures through time. Second, as Metcalf
et al. [65] argue, the impact is co-constructed by all the actors linked to an algorithmic system:
developers, designers, decision-makers, public and private organisations, and most importantly the
affected communities. Therefore, it is fundamental to involve each of these actors while defining the
AIA practice, a vision shared also in [97]. While the exploration of the long-term impact is already
on the agenda of RS practitioners, and as discussed in the next section mostly addressed by the use
of simulated environments, the involvement of the wider community of people affected by RS is
still rare to find. A notable exception is a work by Ferraro [22] considering the artists’ perspective
on the impact of music recommendation, wherein he interviews several artists to understand how
effectively algorithmic automated decisions were impacting their work-life. In the music field,
another example that is worth mentioning is the work done in the Algorithmic Responsibility
research area at Spotify, resulting in the development of AIA in the platform [87].
A limitation of current impact-oriented RS research is the lack of assembling a wide range
of expertise. Indeed, being RS research mostly driven by computer science-inspired approaches,
most of what until now has been measured as impact is the result of technical and engineering
knowledge. Despite the several efforts to properly develop robust metrics and evaluation procedures,
1 https://iaia.org

the narrowness of the considered approaches has been counterproductive because it limited the
concept of impact itself to what is measurable according to such procedures, a deterministic
approach by definition which needs to be expanded to make AIA practices shared and effective.
2.2

Diversity in Simulation-based Methods

The interest in impact-oriented research using synthetic data and simulation environments is
rapidly growing within and outside the RS community [19]. However, this growing interest is
accompanied by an equally growing concern about the high heterogeneity and low transparency
of methods, evaluation practices, and more general assumptions on which such simulation studies
are built [102]. Next, we review the simulation-based recommender system literature wherein the
impact on, or the impact of diversity has been studied.
Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) has been applied in several works to understand the long-term
impact of RS [2]. For instance, Zhang et al. [105] centre their attention on simulating users’
consumption strategies, showing how relying on recommendations users may end in the longterm contributing to the decrease of aggregate diversity. Zhou et al. [106] use ABM to study
how preference bias — the distortion in users’ self-reported ratings caused by recommendations
— influences the performance of recommender systems. In particular, they show how the bias
introduced into the system through the users’ ratings may negatively influence the overall diversity
of the recommended items.
Further examples of simulated environments can be found in the RS literature analysing the
impact of feedback loops. Mansoury et al. [62] design an iterative model to analyse the feedback
loop, showing how it may cause a decline in aggregate diversity. Moreover, Jiang et al. [44] provide
a theoretical analysis of the relationship between feedback loops, echo chambers and filter bubbles.
Instead, Chaney et al. [12] by simulating different models of users’ engagement with RS prove
the impact of feedback loops on algorithm confounding, indicating such outcome as the cause of
homogenization of users’ behaviours.
Another strain of simulation-based analysis focuses on comparing the performance of different
typologies of recommender systems. Hazrati et al. [38] create a simulated environment where users
are exposed to different kinds of recommender systems, proving that non-personalized methods
produce the lowest diversity in terms of users’ choices. Ferraro et al. [23] focus on the analysis of
several session-based recommendation techniques in the music domain, using an iterative approach
wherein users are assumed to interact with a fraction of the recommended tracks. The authors
show that in terms of the spread and coverage of recommendations, the various systems analysed
led to an increased concentration effect over time. The same simulation technique is presented by
Jannach et al. [42], this time in the context of movie recommendations, where again the authors
show how different algorithms lead to highly different performances in both recommendations
spread and coverage.
Under a different lens, sales diversity is at the centre of attention in a series of studies by Fleder
and Hosangar [25, 26] and Lee and Hosanagar [56, 57]. Fleder and Hosangar prove that collaborative
filtering recommender systems exert a concentration bias, early delineating the idea that it may be
possible that, at the individual level, diversity may increase, while at the aggregate level, diversity
may decrease. Lee and Hosanger using field experiment data confirm such results, highlighting
how users do effectively explore novel items thanks to the recommendations, but such explorations
are highly correlated among users.
The impact on content and source diversity has been also investigated. Haim et al. [35] model four
agents interacting with a personalised news recommender system in order to study the effect of
personalization on diversity. They do no evidence of any strong link between personalization and
content and source diversity, as similarly found in [66]. Moreover, Aridor et al. [6] use numerical
4

,,

simulations to model user decision-making processes, providing an explanation of the findings of a
previous study by Nguyen et al. [71] on the influence of recommender systems on content diversity.
In the latter, the authors found that users’ interacting with the provided recommendations ended
up consuming more diverse content in comparison to the users who did not. Aridor and colleagues
confirm such results by means of their simulation, but also observe an increase in the homogeneity
across users i.e. decrease in aggregate diversity.
2.3

Impact of Music Exposure

Several scholars in the music psychology and education field investigated the role of music exposure
in influencing stereotypes and attitudes, and we highlight some examples hereafter.
Greitemeyer and colleagues [33] prove that exposure to music with pro-integration lyrics may
reduce prejudice and discrimination towards immigrant groups, and later in [32] they show that
exposing listeners to music with pro-equality lyrics may enhance positive attitudes and behaviours
toward women. In both cases, the authors found that the musical characteristics of the music
exposed and the preference for it do not influence such impacts. Clarke et al. [14] investigate the
relationship between music, empathy and cultural understanding, showing that music exposure
may indeed generate a sense of affiliation with unknown cultures. Their results are expanded in
[99], confirming that, especially in listeners with high trait empathy, music may increase positive
implicit attitudes towards images representing members of foreign cultures. Tu [94] provides
empirical evidence that exposing young students to 10 minutes of a Chinese music curriculum,
when prolonged for 10 weeks, may impact the attitudes towards Chinese people. In a similar study,
Sousa et al. [85] show that exposure to Cape Verdean songs together with Portuguese songs may
reduce anti-dark-skinned stereotyping among light-skinned Portuguese children. Even if these
examples consider different stimuli and different subjects, they all provide evidence that music
listening may impact the idea that we have about other social groups, and more broadly about
other cultures.
Another strain of research in the field of Music Psychology has been interested in understanding
the impact of repeated exposure on music preference, based on Berlyne’s psychobiological theory
(see [13] for an overview). Among his several contributions, he theorised the existence of a relationship between aesthetic preferences and familiarity. Even if some studies support his claims,
e.g., [92], while others confute it, e.g., [61], nowadays it is commonly accepted that familiarity
with music has a prominent role in the development of preferences [45], a topic in which also
neuroscience practitioners extensively debate [27]. These studies motivate our interest in exploring
the impact that music recommendation diversity may have, connecting exposure, familiarity, and
preferences. Indeed, whilst music recommender systems are known to be influential on exposure
diversity [39, 77], less is known about how such exposure diversity may affect the users’ opinions,
beliefs and attitudes.

STUDY DESIGN

The study is divided into four main stages, namely prescreening, PRE, COND and POST, detailed
hereafter. First, we designed a prescreening online survey to select subjects matching a set of
criteria, presented in Section 3.2. After selecting the desired set of participants, we started collecting
their data using two methods. First, we asked them to create a ListenBrainz2 account to gather
information about their listening habits (Section 3.3). Additionally, participants completed the
Electronic Music Feedback (EMF) questionnaire, where they provided their opinion about several

aspects of EM (Section 3.4). For the following four weeks, no further actions were required to the
participants. This stage of the experiment is referred to as PRE.
In the 5th week, participants started to be exposed to music recommendations in what we call
the COND (conditioning) stage. At that point, participants were already randomly divided into
two groups, one receiving high diversity (HD) and the other low diversity (LD) recommendations,
created following the procedure described in Section 4. For four weeks, from Monday to Friday,
participants received on a daily basis an audio mix to be listened to, for a total of 20 listening
sessions (Section 3.5). After each listening session, additional feedback was collected by asking
participants their impressions about the music listened to. During this stage, they were also asked
to complete the EMF questionnaire on a weekly basis, on Saturday. At the start of the 9th week,
the COND stage ended and the POST stage started. Again for four weeks, no further actions were
required to the participants. Finally, at the end of the 12th week, we asked participants first to fill
for the last time the EMF questionnaire, and then to fill out the End-of-Study (EoS) survey described
in Section 3.6. Figure 1 depicts the study’s high-level structure.

Recruitment and Informed Consent

The Institutional Committee for Ethical Review of Projects (CIREP) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra
approved the study design and confirmed the compliance of the research project with the data
protection legal framework, namely, with the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU)
2016/679 (GDPR) and Spanish Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5th, on Protection of Personal
Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights (LOPDGDD). A digital copy of the submitted documentation,
the ethics certificate and the data protection certificate is available upon request.
Before the main study, a smaller-scale pilot study was conducted to test the data collection
process. The pilot study took place in February and April 2022, and the main study took place from
May to July 2022. All participants were recruited using the online recruitment service Prolific,3 and
they were paid £6.00 per hour, the recommended minimum pay. They were informed about the
voluntary nature of their participation, having the freedom to withdraw at any point, and of their
rights including the right to access, rectify, and delete their information. They were also shown the
information sheet describing the research objectives, methodology, risks, and benefits. Informed
consent was obtained from all participants.

Prescreening

The prescreening of the participants was performed as a two-step process: first, using pre-determined
criteria that are available in the recruiting platform (Prolific), and then, based on a questionnaire.
In the first step, we selected participants based on age (18-42), nationality and country of residence
(Italy, Spain, and Portugal), fluent in English, who had participated in at least 20 surveys in Prolific,
and with a task approval rate above 90%. In terms of gender, sex, and education level, no filter was
applied. We chose to limit age including only Millennials and Generation Z subjects, i.e., those
born between 1981 and 2012, known to have a predilection for Electronic Music (EM) [60, 72, 98],
but also to narrow the generational differences among participants. The selection of only three
countries in Southern Europe was motivated by the idea of having participants: 1) with a relatively
similar cultural background; 2) living in the same time zone (GMT +1/+2). This last factor was
fundamental to facilitating the daily interaction between participants and the researchers, being
they resident in the same time zone.
Subjects matching the aforementioned criteria were redirected to the second part of the prescreening that consisted of a questionnaire in PsyToolkit [89, 90], a web-based framework to conduct
psychological surveys and experiments. The questionnaire was composed of three main parts. In
the first part, we asked participants to optionally confirm their demographic information. This
step was included to double-check the reliability of the information provided by Prolific. In the
second part, we asked for additional information about participants’ listening habits. In detail, they
self-assessed with 5-point Likert items their taste variety, EM listening frequency, and EM taste
variety. Additionally, we asked them to indicate the preferred music streaming platform and the
average daily time spent listening to music. This information was used to filter out participants
who self-declared to listen to EM very often, who indicated listening to music less than an hour a
day, and who did not select Spotify as the preferred streaming service. The latter condition was
necessary for collecting participants’ listening logs through ListenBrainz, as explained in the next
section. The former two conditions were designed to create a group of subjects who listen to music
more than occasionally, but who are not EM frequent listeners.
In the third part, we included a test to verify the participants’ familiarity with EM artists and
genres. We replicated the test proposed in a previous study [79], summarised hereafter. Participants
had to specify whom from a list of mainstream EM artists was (i) known, (ii) possibly known or
(iii) unknown to them. The list was composed of 20 artists selected by AllMusic, an expert-curated
online music database, as representatives of EM [4]. Afterwards, they had to do the same task
for a list of EM genres, composed of 20 genres part of the Wikipedia page about EM [100]. The
final score of each test, separately for artists and genres, was computed giving more points to
participants who knew less popular artists (or genres). The rationale behind this is that knowing
a popular EM artist or genre (such as Skrillex, or dubstep) makes you less a connoisseur of EM
at large, in comparison to knowing a less popular EM artist or genre (such as Autechre, or IDM).
The popularity of each artist and genre was computed using several signals from Spotify, Twitter,
Facebook, Deezer, SoundCloud, and Last.fm, aggregated using the GAP0 metric proposed in [53]. The
list of artists and genres and the corresponding GAP0 score is presented in Appendix B (Figures
17 and 18). We filter out participants who according to this test were too familiar with EM. In
summary, the following criteria were used for the prescreening:
• First prescreening step
– Age: 18-42
– Nationality & country of residence: Italy, Spain, Portugal
– Gender and sex: No restrictions
– Highest education level: No restrictions
7

Lorenzo Porcaro, Emilia Gómez, & Carlos Castillo

– Fluent languages: English
– Number of Prolific previous submissions: > 20
– Prolific approval rate: 90%
• Second prescreening step
– Taste variety (self-declared): No restrictions
– EM taste variety (self-declared): No restrictions
– EM listening frequency (self-declared): Not very often
– Preferred music streaming platform: Spotify
– Average daily listening time (self-declared): > 1 hour
– Average EM familiarity score: < 5 (over 10.5)
This prescreening allowed us to select a population of listeners quite homogenous in terms of
demographics, listening habits and familiarity with EM. Indeed, our main goal is to study the
impact of EM recommendations on people who are not experts nor huge fans of this genre. We
also aimed at reducing the response variability caused by different cultural backgrounds. These
two aspects, familiarity with EM and cultural background, have been shown to be at the root of
different perceptions of diversity in music lists [79], and by controlling for those while selecting
the study participants, we aimed at minimizing the influence of such factors in the analysis.
3.3

Listening Logs Collection

After being selected for participating in the study, participants were asked to create an account
on ListenBrainz, allowing the collection of their listening logs for the entire duration of the study.
ListenBrainz is a platform that keeps track of what music its users listen to and provides them
with insights into their listening habits. It is operated by the MetaBrainz foundation,4 a nonprofit organisation that has been set up to build community-maintained databases and make them
available in the public domain or under Creative Commons licences. Data is collected complying
with the GDPR, and more information about MetaBrainz privacy policy can be found online.
Among the options for submitting the music listened to, it is possible to link Listenbrainz to the
Spotify account. One of the advantages of this approach is the reliability of the metadata accessible
for each log. Indeed, once a log is collected by ListenBrainz through its link with Spotify, the
associated Spotify track ID and artist ID are available. With the retrieved IDs, by using the Spotify
Web API,5 it is possible to obtain several types of data, from the acoustic properties of a track to
the genres associated with the artists. However, a few drawbacks of this method to collect listening
logs are noticeable.
First, creating a ListenBrainz account is a time-consuming task for which participants need
to be paid, increasing the cost of the experiment. Moreover, for privacy reasons people may be
reluctant to link their ListenBrainz and Spotify accounts. Lastly, whilst the use of the Spotify API
is quite accepted in the Music IR and RS communities, the proprietary nature of the algorithms
behind the API makes it difficult to know exactly how the data is generated. Nonetheless, by using
ListenBrainz we aimed to foster the reproducibility of our study, but also to ensure the availability
of the collected data for future works making them publicly available through the ListenBrainz API.
3.4

Electronic Music Feedback Questionnaire

The Electronic Music Feedback (EMF) questionnaire is designed to measure implicit and explicit
attitudes towards EM. Participants completed it at the beginning, four times while being exposed
to the music recommendations, and the last time at the end of the study, for a total of six times

,,

(see Figure 1). In particular, the EMF measures: 1) the participants’ openness in listening to EM; 2)
the valence of their implicit association with EM; 3) the stereotypes they associated with EM. It is
implemented in PsyToolkit, and the time needed to complete it is approximately 10 minutes. We
now continue describing separately the three parts of the questionnaire.
3.4.1 Measuring Openness. Openness in listening to EM is measured using a dichotomous Guttman
scale [34]. It is a unidimensional ordinal cumulative scale for the assessment of an attribute, in
this study namely the openness in listening to EM. In detail, subjects are asked if they would be
open to listening to one hour of EM, selecting Yes or No to the following options: a) once every
month; b) once every two weeks; c) once a week; d) twice a week; e) every day. The ordinal nature
of the scale suggests that a participant answering No to the first option, naturally would answer
No to the following questions, as shown in Table 1. The score of this scale ranges from 0 for
participants declaring to be not open to listening to even one hour per month of EM, to 5 for
participants affirming to be open to listening to EM one hour every day. Among the advantages
of using the Guttman scale are its compact form and pretty intuitive nature while analysing the
scores, apart from the ease of computing the score by simply looking for affirmative answers from
the participants. Having an interest in understanding how music recommendations with different
levels of diversity may affect the participants’ openness in listening to EM, we used the score
obtained from the Guttman scale as one of the variables of the longitudinal analysis, for the rest of
the paper referred to as o-score.

Music” for measuring the openness in listening to EM. 0 represent a negative answer, while 1 is an affirmative
answer.

3.4.2 Measuring Implicit Association. People’s conscious judgement represents only a facet of
how evaluative associations are experienced. This is why we included in the questionnaire the
Single Category Implicit Association Test (SC-IAT) [48], a variant of the more famous Implicit
Association Test (IAT) [31]. The IAT aims at measuring implicit attitudes, defined as “actions or
judgments that are under the control of automatically activated evaluation, without the performer’s
awareness of that causation” [31]. By measuring the response latencies in a categorization task,
the IAT evaluates the strengths of associations between concepts, using complementary pairs of
concepts and attributes. For instance, IAT has been used to measure people’s positive or negative
associations with Women and Men, Black and White people, or Transgender and Cisgender people.
Several examples of IATs can be found on the Project Implicit webpage.6
In the music field, Clarke, Vuoskoski and DeNora [14, 99] made use of the IAT for measuring if
mere exposure to music may evoke empathy towards unknown cultures. Their findings support
the hypothesis that, even without any accessible semantic content, listening to music can evoke

empathy and affiliation in listeners. Inspired by their results, we chose to implement an SC-IAT to
understand if exposure to EM may influence the implicit association of listeners. The use of SC-IAT
rather than IAT has been motivated by the absence of a complementary category to EM.
In summary, using the keyboard participants have been asked to categorise as fast as possible: 1)
pleasant words (Joy, Love, Peace, Wonderful, Pleasure, Glorious, Laughter, Happy); 2) unpleasant
words (Agony, Terrible, Horrible, Nasty, Evil, Awful, Failure, Hurt); 3) EM genres (Dubstep, Techno,
Electronica, Hardcore, Vaporwave, Breakbeat, Electroacoustic, Downtempo). By measuring the time
they employed in categorising these words correctly, we evaluated participant associations’ valence
towards Electronic Music. The outcome of this test is referred to as d-score, which takes negative
values if a negative valence is associated with EM and positive values in the opposite case.7 Karpinski
and Steinman [48] provide a detailed description of the SC-IAT design, the formula for computing
the d-score, and proof of its reliability and validity.
3.4.3 Measuring Stereotypes. The goal of this part of the EMF questionnaire is to measure what
listeners opine on three kinds of stereotypes: 1) the context wherein they listen to EM; 2) the
musical properties they associate with EM tracks; 3) the characteristics of EM artists they think are
prominent. Responses are collected by using 5-point Likert items. First, participants are asked in
which contexts they would listen to EM presenting a list of eight activities (Relaxing, Commuting,
Partying, Running, Shopping, Sleeping, Studying, Working), selecting an option ranging from Totally
Disagree to Totally Agree. In order to analyse the stereotypes associated with EM tracks’ musical
properties, we ask questions about: a) tempo (0: mostly slow, 5: mostly fast), b) level of danceability,
c) presence of acoustic instruments, e.g. violin, trumpet, acoustic guitar , and d) presence of singing
voice parts (0: mostly low, 5: mostly high). The reason why we selected these four features is twofold.
First, they exemplify some of the stereotypes usually associated with EM, e.g., it has a fast tempo,
high danceability, and low acousticness. Second, these features are among the ones retrievable at a
track level (see Appendix A).
Lastly, participants’ feedback on which characteristics they associate with Electronic Music
artists is collected, focusing on: gender (0: mostly women or other gender minorities, 5: mostly
men); skin colour (0: mostly white-skinned, 5: mostly dark-skinned); origin (0: mostly low-income /
developing countries, 5: mostly high-income / developed countries); and age (0: mostly under 40, 5:
mostly over 40). Considering the nature of the experiment, no impact on the answers related to the
artists was expected to be caused by the exposure, because no information about the artists was
provided during the listening session. Nevertheless, understanding the EM artists’ characteristics
that participants felt to be more representative is a complementary perspective on the stereotypes
they associated with EM. Even if not influenced by the provided music recommendation, these
questions gave us further insights into what ideas the participants had about EM.
3.5

Listening Sessions

Participants’ exposure to EM recommendations took place during the twenty daily listening sessions
part of the COND stage. Being the sessions proposed on a daily basis, their design favoured the
easiness and rapidness of completing the proposed task, described as follows. As an initial step, a
thirty-second audio clip was presented to calibrate the audio volume, to avoid exposing participants
to extremely louder audio potentially damaging their hearing. Afterwards, we explicitly asked
participants to entirely listen to a 3 minutes audio containing a mix of a few excerpts of EM tracks,
asking them to be sure to be in a quiet environment and to allow themselves to be immersed in the
music.

Assessing the Impact of Music Recommendation Diversity on Listeners: A Longitudinal Study

,,

After each listening section, the participants provided their feedback on the music listened to.
Specifically, they indicated with a 5-point Likert item if they liked or disliked the music, and they
selected if the listened music was familiar or not. With that, the mandatory part of the listening
session ended. Following, on a voluntary basis, they were asked if they wanted to explore the
playlist with the full tracks part of the audio previously listened to. If selecting Yes, they were
redirected to a page with a link to a YouTube playlist. If they were not interested in discovering,
the listening session ended. The time needed to complete the mandatory part of each session was
approximately 5 minutes. It is important to note that the interaction with the playlists was declared
to be completely optional and did not affect the participants’ payment, i.e. they were not paid for
the time extra spent interacting with the playlists. Figure 2 depicts the structure of a listening
session.

Fig. 2. Flow diagram representing a listening session.

This design allowed us to collect several types of data. First, the explicit liking and the familiarity
ratings of the tracks listened to. Second, the willingness of discovering more about such tracks,
by choosing to explore the playlists. Third, by checking the YouTube playlist views, we also had
a further metric of the actual interaction with the music proposed daily. Whilst the definition of
“legitimate view” in YouTube is not transparent [104], a common belief is that to increase views a
user has to click the play button to begin the video, and the video has to be played for at least 30
seconds. Even if we cannot validate these hypotheses, we double-checked that simply accessing a
YouTube playlist without listening to any tracks does not increase the view count of such playlists.
We chose to avoid redirecting participants to Spotify playlists to not confound the listening log
collections and the platform usage. Indeed, Spotify algorithms could have registered the signal of
participants’ interaction with such playlists influencing eventually future recommendations by
including EM related to the study. Lastly, YouTube playlists were not made public but accessible
only to the participants of the experiment, to avoid affecting the view count with interactions from
external users.
3.6

End-of-Study Survey

Over the course of the study, we collected several types of feedback, implicit and explicit, quantitative
and qualitative, that we used to understand the impact of music recommendation diversity. As the
last step, we included a final survey to collect participants’ overall feedback on their participation.
It is composed of four sections. The first section (16 Likert items) includes questions about the
participants’ relationship with EM before participating in the study. The second (16 items) collects
feedback about the experience of participants during the study. In the third (21 items), we ask
about participants’ feelings about EM after the study. Lastly, we insert a final section (8 items)
to understand the overall impression of participating in the study. The complete list of items is
presented in the supplementary material.8

The survey is built to investigate the participants’ openness, appreciation and willingness to
discover EM. Besides, a few questions are related to stereotypes associated with this genre (e.g., EM
has a fast tempo or it is mostly for partying), while others are about the perceived variety of the
genre itself. In order to avoid acquiescence bias we balanced the number of positive and negative
statements in each section, and items were presented in a randomised fashion to avoid order effect
bias. The time needed to complete this survey is approximately 10 minutes.

MATERIAL

This section outlines the semi-automatic procedure to create the diversified recommendations to
which participants were exposed during the listening sessions. We report here a summary of the
several steps carried out, including in Appendix A a detailed description of the process.
The first step was to create a dataset of candidate EM tracks to be included in the listening
sessions. The goal was to select a set of tracks covering as many EM styles as possible to create
a varied representation of the EM culture, however without the presumption of including every
existing nuance of it. We consulted Wikipedia [100] and Every Noise at Once9 (ENO) to select
20 EM genres with associated 165 subgenres, listed in Table 7. For each of the subgenres, we
retrieved from ENO a playlist of around 100 representative tracks for a total of around 16 thousand
tracks. Then, we filtered out tracks too popular by using the Spotify popularity indicator and the
YouTube view count, to avoid that familiarity with the music listened to could have an effect on
participants’ ratings. Lastly, we randomly select 10 tracks (when available, if not less) for each
subgenre, remaining with a final set of 1444 candidate tracks.
As a second step, we made use of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) techniques to design a
diversification model. This was a three-step process: 1) we extracted audio embedding from the
candidate tracks using state-of-the-art Deep Learning models; 2) we validated these models by
using standard MIR hand-crafted features; 3) we designed the diversification process to obtain EM
recommendations.
Tracks’ audio embeddings were extracted using EfficientNet [93] trained with a dataset of
tracks annotated with Discogs10 metadata. Among the four models tested, this showed the best
performance in terms of clustering the candidate tracks coherently with respect to the considered
taxonomy of EM genres. Figure 13 (Appendix B) displays a 2-dimensional representation of the
embedded space obtained with this model. Then, focusing on four features (tempo, danceability,
acousticness and instrumentalness) we investigated the consistency of the tracks’ embedded space.
In particular, we centre our attention on if track embeddings clustered together displayed similarity
also in terms of the aforementioned features.
We continued by creating two sets of 20 recommendation lists, one list for each listening session,
the first set with high and the second with low inter-list diversity, from now on the High Diversity
(HD) and Low Diversity (LD) lists. In the set of HD lists, the idea was to have tracks spanning
different EM, giving to the listeners the opportunity to discover different facets of this culture
throughout the study. In order to do that, we create one list for each of the 20 genres in the dataset.
On the contrary, LD lists were focused on a single genre (trance) for having 20 listening sessions
quite homogeneous. Figure 16 provides a 2-dimensional representation of the recommendation lists
obtained using the two diversification strategies (HD and LD). Besides, every list was formed by
four tracks having the minimum average distance in the embedded space, to minimise the intra-list
diversity. Thanks to this, we ensured that each session was coherent and pleasant to listen to,
avoiding to include in the same session tracks with very different musical traits.

Once having the 20 HD and 20 LD recommendation lists, each one formed by 4 tracks, the last
step was to create the audio mixes to be listened to by the participants in our study. We did that by
randomly selecting 45 seconds of every track, creating 3-minute long mixes. The list of tracks used
in the listening sessions,11 and the audio mixes 12 are publicly available.

RESULTS

This section introduces the results of the analysis of participants’ feedback and listening logs
collected during the twelve weeks of the experiment. We start by describing in Section 5.1 the
population of our study, commenting on demographics, listening habits, and familiarity with EM,
including in Section 5.1.1 the analysis of the data retrieved from ListenBrainz. Then, we continue
in Section 5.2 reporting on the participants’ group assignments, participation and drop-out rate. In
Section 5.3, we analyze participants’ feedback during the 20 listening sessions. Afterwards, Section
5.4 includes the longitudinal analysis of the Electronic Music Feedback (EMF) questionnaire’s
responses, focusing first on openness and implicit association, and then on EM stereotypes. Lastly,
Section 5.5 presents the results of the End-of-Study survey.
5.1

Participants’ Demographics and Listening Habits

The exploratory nature of the study, and the lack of any meta-analysis that defines the ground
truths of our variables, made it difficult to estimate with a power analysis the exact number of
participants needed in order to observe potentially existing statistical differences. Nonetheless,
guidelines from Human-Computer Interaction research helped us in estimating a valid number
of participants [11, 15, 47]. Indeed, when performing a t-test (or an equivalent non-parametric
statistical hypothesis test) for the difference between two independent means, to observe a medium
effect size (an effect likely to be visible to the naked eye of a careful observer), at a significance level
of 𝛼 = .10 (acceptable for an exploratory study), with a statistical power of .80 (to avoid incurring
a too great risk of a Type II error), according to Cohen [15], it is required a sample of size 100
participants, i.e. 50 participants for each group. This is the reason why following the prescreening
we recruited 110 participants for this study, also foreseeing the eventuality of some of them
dropping out.
Most of the selected participants are aged between 18 and 32 years old (91%), come from Portugal
(61%), Italy (32%) or Spain (7%), almost equally divided into binary genders (53% women and 44%
men)13 with a small fraction of non-binary participants (3%). In terms of education, 69% have a
bachelor’s degree or lower, and 63% indicate to still studying. According to their self-declared
answers, the 88% affirm having varied listening habits, only a quarter affirms listening often to EM,
and a third affirms listening to a varied selection of EM. In terms of listening time, 78% declare to
daily listening on average between 1 and 3 hours of music.
The two familiarity tests (artist and genre, see Section 3) help us in estimating the participants’
knowledge of the Electronic Music (EM) scene. The test score ranges from 0, if no item in the
lists is known, to 10.5 if all items are known. In the artist test, the average score obtained by the
selected participants (𝑁 = 110) is 1.7±1.2. Instead, the average score of all the participants in the
prescreening (𝑁 = 437) is 2.6±2.1. In terms of genre familiarity, the average score is 5.1±1.6 against
5.7±1.9. Averaging over the two tests, the recruited participants got 3.4±1.1 against 4.2±1.8. As
these numbers evidence, the filter applied during the prescreening made it possible to select a group

of participants on average less familiar with mainstream EM artists and genres in comparison to a
wider group of listeners with shared demographics.
Further characterization of the study participants may be done by looking at the average d-score
(implicit association) and o-score (openness) obtained after the first Electronic Music Feedback
(EMF) questionnaire in the PRE stage. Indeed, at the beginning of the experiment participants
affirmed being open to listening to Electronic Music, with a median o-score of 4 with an interquartile
range of 2.75, and did not attach a negative nor positive valence to EM, having an average d-score
of –0.09±0.42. In the next section, we further characterize the study participants by analyzing their
listening logs.
5.1.1 Listening Logs Analysis. The ListenBrainz listening logs give us an alternative perspective
for understanding the relationship that the participants have with EM. Unfortunately, the analysis
comprehends only data from 66 accounts because technical issues limited the stability of the
connection between Spotify and Listenbrainz, which eventually made it impossible to collect data
from all the participants. Nonetheless, the collected data are representative of some trends that we
describe hereafter.
We start by analysing the participants’ log-playcount over the course of the study, considering
first the whole set of listening logs, and then only the EM logs.14 On average, participants listened to
1479 tracks over the course of the study, more or less a daily hour of music if considering 3-minute
long tracks. In contrast, during the study they listened on average only to 56 EM tracks, meaning
more or less 1 EM track a day. Figure 3 (top) displays the distribution of the log-playcount separately
over the whole tracks (left), and only for EM tracks (right). We may observe that several participants
have an EM log-playcount lower than 1, i.e. they listened to less than 10 EM tracks over the course
of the study. Overall, for more than half of the study participants EM represents less than 15% of
the whole music listened to.
Moreover, to understand the variety of their listening habits, we compute the Gini index separately
with the whole set of listening logs, and only with the EM logs. For the latter set, the average Gini
index (0.43±0.20) is smaller than the one computed with the whole set of logs (0.62±0.09). This
indicates that participants seem to have on average more varied habits in terms of EM in comparison
to the whole music they listened to. Figure 3 (bottom) shows the relationship between the Gini
index and log-playcount. We observe that they are positively correlated (𝜌 = .62, 𝑝 < .01), with an
even stronger linear correlation between the two variables in the case of EM logs (𝜌 = .86, 𝑝 < .01).
This supports the idea that the more a participant listened to EM, the less varied it was. Hence, also
taking into account the self-declared and estimated not-expertise of participants with respect to EM,
we hypothesise the presence of two groups of listeners in our study: a) occasional heterogenous
EM listeners, with a low Gini index (0.0–0.5) and low log-playcount (0–2); b) more-than-occasional
homogenous EM listeners, with a high Gini index (0.5–1.0) and high log-playcount (2–4).
What quantitatively shown until now give us an idea of the study participants’ listening habits,
which however can be further complemented by looking at what kind of Electronic Music was most
listened to. Figures 20, 21 in Appendix B display the top genres and artists ranked by popularity
in the participants’ logs, from which we may infer some trends. Indeed, we note that House and
Electronic Dance Music (EDM) alone constitute 75% of the EM that participants listened to over
the twelve weeks. Such results do not come as surprise, because as previously commented the
demographic segmentation of the participants in our study to some extent is similar to the one of
EDM listeners [98]. The most frequent artists in the logs, David Guetta, Avicii and Alok, among the
most popular in the scene, confirm the predisposition of the participants to mainstream EM.
14 We consider as EM log a track listened to by a participant that is composed or performed by an artist associated with one

or more EM genres among the ones retrieved from the Spotify API.

Fig. 3. Distribution of the participants’ log-playcount (top), and log-playcount versus Gini index (bottom),
computed with the whole set of logs (left), and only with EM logs (right).

Based on these observations, we may draw the following picture of the population of our study.
They are Millenials and Gen Z from Southern Europe, equally divided into binary genders with a
small fraction of non-binary, mostly without a graduate degree and still studying. Average in terms
of time spent listening to music and having a self-appearance of having heterogeneous preferences,
they affirm to not be heavy listeners of EM nor particularly varied in terms of EM listened to. Familiar
with the mainstream EM artists and genres, but far to be considered experts of the genre, they may
be grouped into occasional heterogenous EM listeners and more-than-occasional homogenous EM
listeners, mostly listening to House and EDM.
5.2

Grouping, Participation and Dropout Rate

After selecting the participants matching our prescreening criteria, we needed to split them into
two groups, one to be exposed to recommendations with high diversity and one with low diversity.
During the pilot study we realised that, given the size of the sample, randomly assigning participants
to groups could result in an unbalanced baseline for the variables we were interested in studying.
For instance, one group could have been formed by participants much more open to listening to
EM than the other group. In order to avoid imbalance between characteristics, which may have
affected the impact of the recommendations, we assigned participants using covariate adaptive
randomization [91], creating two groups balanced in terms of familiarity with EM (familiarity test
score), openness in listening to EM (o-score), implicit association with EM (d-score), and the number
of EM tracks listened to during the PRE stage. At the end of this process, we got a group of 55
participants assigned to the High Diversity (HD) condition, and a group of 55 participants assigned
to the Low Diversity (LD) condition, from now on the HD group and the LD group.
Table 2 summarises the participation of the two groups in the EMF questionnaire and in the
listening sessions. Not surprisingly, participation decreased over the course of the study, notably
between the PRE and POST phase in the EMF questionnaire (-19%), and less between the first and
fourth week of the listening sessions (-4%). Overall, we may notice a small difference between the
15

,,

Lorenzo Porcaro, Emilia Gómez, & Carlos Castillo

two groups, with the LD participants being more active during the study than their HD counterparts.
Some participants have been excluded during the course of the study if a) they never showed up
after being selected (initial nonresponse), or b) after a certain point they stop participating (attrition).
The initial nonresponse was quite high for the EMF questionnaire (HD: 7%, LD: 5%), but relatively
small for the listening sessions (HD: 5%, LD: 0%). Instead, attrition was equal for both tasks (HD:
7%, LD: 2%). These numbers are in line with retention rates observed in Prolific and generally in
longitudinal studies [18, 52].
In conclusion, we excluded from the analysis the responses of the participants who did not
participate in: a) more than 4 listening sessions, and b) more than 3 EMF questionnaires. With this
choice, we ended up analysing the responses of 94 over 110 participants (85%), 45 over 55 in the
HD group (82%) and 49 over 55 in the LD group (89%).

Listening Sessions Analysis

During the 20 listening sessions in the COND stage, we collected four types of data to measure
the impact that recommendations had on the participants of the High Diversity (HD) and Low
Diversity (LD) groups:
– Playlist accesses: assigning 1 to a participant who after a session chose to explore the session’s
playlist, 0 otherwise.
– Playlist interactions: YouTube playlist’s view count, aggregated over each group of participants.
– Like ratings: ranging from -2 if a listening session was totally disliked by a participant, to 2 if
a session was totally liked.
– Familiarity ratings: 1 if the tracks in a listening session were familiar to a participant, -1 if
unfamiliar, 0 if unsure.
Figure 4 displays the distribution of playlists’ accesses and interactions, where trend lines
are computed with the linear least squares method. Similarly to the overall decrease in study
participation, we may note that over the course of the sessions the overall engagement with the
playlists decreased. Looking at the number of accesses and interactions, the HD participants seem
to be more interested in discovering the music listened to than the LD ones. Moreover, we notice
that on several sessions LD participants accessed a playlist but had zero interactions with it (e.g.,
sessions 10 and 11). This phenomenon never occurred to HD participants, who on the contrary in
some sessions had much more interactions than accesses (e.g., sessions 5 and 17), meaning that
16

Assessing the Impact of Music Recommendation Diversity on Listeners: A Longitudinal Study

,,

some participants interacted several times with the same playlist. Naturally, in both groups accesses
and interactions are positively correlated (HD: 𝜌 = .75, LD: 𝜌 = .51).
Figures 5 and 6 merge the playlists’ data and the like ratings, giving us an alternative view for
understanding the participants’ reception of the recommendations. In Figure 5, it emerges that the
HD group disliked more sessions and with more extreme ratings compared to the LD group, who
on average seem to have appreciated most of the music they have been exposed to. Nevertheless,
HD participants even when they mostly disliked a session, interact with the playlists on YouTube
(e.g., sessions 4 and 17).
Such behaviour is confirmed in Figure 6, where like ratings are split between participants who
accessed the playlists (light bars) and those who did not (dark bars). We see that some of the HD
participants choose to access the playlist and discover more about the tracks listened to even in the
most disliked sessions (negative light bars), a phenomenon not visible for the LD group. On the
contrary, some of the LD participants even if liking the tracks listened to, choose to not interact
with the playlists (positive bars with zero interactions, e.g., Figure 5, sessions 10 and 11), or not
access the playlists (positive dark bars, e.g., Figure 6, sessions 4 and 10).
The familiarity ratings’ results are shown in Appendix B (Figures 22 and 23) and summarised
as follows. The sum of ratings is negative for almost every session, indicating that the tracks
were mostly unfamiliar to the participants.15 This trend was expected because of participants’
not-familiarity with EM, but also because of the popularity filter applied before creating the
recommendations. Besides, we observe a positive correlation between like and familiarity ratings
(HD: 𝜌 = .55, LD: 𝜌 = .72), confirming what previous music psychology scholars have extensively
proven: the more familiar a track sounds, the more is likely to be liked.
These few observations led us to formulate and test the following hypothesis:
H1. The HD group will have more accesses to playlists than the LD group.
H2. The HD group will have more interactions with playlists than the LD group.
15 There is one exception in session 4 for the LD group, presenting a positive peak not in line with the rest of the sessions.
This is due to one of the tracks included in that session “Around The World (La La La La) (Ultra Flirt Hands Up Remix Edit)”,
a remix of the famous track by A Touch Of Class (ATC).

H3. The LD group will like the tracks more than the HD group.
H4. The LD group will like more tracks without accessing the playlist than the HD group.
H5. The HD and LD groups will have the same level of familiarity with the listened tracks.
We test the aforementioned hypothesis by performing Mann-Whitney U tests, commonly used to
compare the differences between two independent samples when the sample distributions are not
normally distributed and the sample sizes are small. Table 3 reports the outcomes of the tests. H1
and H2 are confirmed by a significant statistical difference between HD and LD groups in terms of
playlist accesses and interactions. In terms of like ratings, we see a smaller effect size with only 62%
of sessions having HD group ratings lower than the LD ones (H3). This proportion increases to 70%
18

Assessing the Impact of Music Recommendation Diversity on Listeners: A Longitudinal Study

,,

if looking only at the ratings of participants who did not access the playlists (H4). This confirms
that even when LD participants liked the listening sessions, they interacted with the playlists less
than the HD group. Lastly, looking at the familiarity ratings no significant difference is found (H5),
confirming the hypothesis and also that the design of the listening session was effective, exposing
subjects to music they were mostly unfamiliar with.

EMF Questionnaire Analysis

Through the analysis of the listening sessions, we have shown the distinct reactions of the two
groups of participants when receiving the music recommendations. Hereinafter, we continue by
focusing on the impact of the exposure to EM recommendations, first, in terms of openness in
listening and implicit association, and second, in terms of stereotypes that participants associate
with this music genre.
5.4.1 d-score and o-score. The d-score measures the implicit association with EM, having negative
values if a negative association is present and positive values in the opposite case. The o-score
measures the openness in listening to EM, ranging from 0 if a participant is not open, to 5 if a
participant is truly open. We collected these scores six times during the longitudinal study, first at
the beginning (PRE), four times during the conditioning phase (COND 1–4), and lastly at the end of
the study after twelve weeks from the start (POST ).
Figure 7 shows the average scores and standard deviations separately for the two groups. In
terms of d-score, we may observe that HD participants’ scores starting from a positive average
decrease toward zero. Even if with more fluctuations, similarly the LD participants end up with an
average score near zero, almost equal to the initial one. Instead, for the o-score both groups present
a slight increase comparing the PRE and POST averages, with LD presenting a higher response
variance.
Table 4 reports the percentages of participants grouped by their scores. For the o-score, we split
the participants into two groups, the less open in listening to EM having a score between 0 and
2, and the more open having between 3 and 5. At the beginning (PRE), the proportion for both
HD and LD groups is around 75–25 (more open–less open), whilst in the POST measurement the
proportion of open participants slightly increases resulting in approximately 80–20.
In terms of the d-score, the proportions in the two groups are initially quite different, with the
HD group having more positive scores than the LD group.16 Notwithstanding, over the course of the
study the participants’ scores move towards zero, with the neutral group (d-score ∈ [−0.25, 0.25])
16 Even if the d-score was included as a covariate while assigning participants to groups using covariate adaptive randomiza-

tion, the higher initial nonresponse in the HD group caused such imbalance.

consisting of almost half of the participants for both HD and LD groups, whilst the positive (d-score
> 0.25) and negative (d-score < 0.25) scores are equally split.
This analysis shows few aspects of the average behaviour of the HD and LD groups, without
however considering individual differences. In order to further confirm what found at the group
level, we explore the association between the rate of change and the initial scores by using the
individual slopes obtained from the regression analysis of each participant’s scores. Figure 8 shows
the slopes describing the trajectory of each participant versus the baseline scores obtained at the
beginning of the study, separately for the d-score and o-score. Each point in the scatter represents
a participant, where if the slope is positive indicates that through the twelve weeks her scores
increased, if negative decreased.
The slopes of the d-score are mostly clustered around zero, meaning that the implicit association
towards EM did not extremely change for most of the participants. In the bottom-right quadrant, a
greater presence of HD participants is visible, who represent the subjects starting with a positive
attitude and then moving towards more negative ones. On the contrary, in the top-left we see
mostly LD participants, representing the opposite scenario. The average slope for the LD group is
20

,,

almost zero, whilst for the HD group is negative, confirming that, overall, participants of this last
group developed less positive implicit association during the study.
We observe a different situation for the o-score, where no particular differences are observed
between groups. Only in the case of the two participants who started the experiment declaring
to be not open to listening to EM neither for one hour a month (baseline score equal to zero),
we clearly observe different slopes. Indeed, the LD participant over the weeks seems to have not
changed her openness, instead, the HD participant has a positive slope. This indicates that even if
at the beginning she was not open to listening to EM at all, eventually she started to be more open
during the study.
Starting from these observations, we formulate two hypotheses on the impact of recommendations on the scores. In fact, over the course of the study for the whole group of participants we
hypothesise that: (H6) the implicit association with EM will tend towards neutral valence, and (H7)
the openness in listening to EM will increase. We use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for testing
this hypothesis. Two comparisons are made, first between the scores in the PRE stage and the ones
at the end of the fourth week of the COND stage (PRE-COND), and then between PRE and POST
stage (PRE-POST ). Using the former, we are able to measure the impact of recommendations on
participants right after being exposed to EM, while with the latter we measure if the impact still
exists after one month from the exposure.
Table 5 reports the outcomes of the tests. In the case of the d-score, after the exposure participants’
scores tendentially decrease, a trend confirmed when looking at the differences between the
beginning and the end of the study. Instead, by analysing the o-score we observe an opposite
behaviour, having an increase right after the exposure, which becomes not significant comparing
the PRE and POST measurements. However, for both scores the effect size was not particularly
large. As a further step, by means of correlation analysis we measure the temporal stability of the
two scores considering again the two intervals PRE-COND and PRE-POST. In terms of d-score we
observe lower stability over time in comparison to the o-score both in the PRE-COND measurements

(d-score: 𝜌 = .30, 𝑝 < .01, o-score: 𝜌 = .57, 𝑝 < .01) and in the PRE-POST measurements (d-score:
𝜌 = .34, 𝑝 < .01, o-score: .53, 𝑝 < .01). These results corroborate the idea that implicit measurement
may be less resistant to situationally induced changes than explicit measures [29].

After highlighting the overall impact of recommendations on the study participants, we are
interested in understanding the role of diversity in such change. Therefore, we implement two
methods to perform a PRE-POST analysis, described as follows. We denote 𝑋𝑖 = 0 if a participant is
part of the LD group, and 𝑋𝑖 = 1 if part of the HD group. For each participant, 𝑌𝑖0 is the measurement
in the PRE stage, and 𝑌𝑖1 at the POST stage. We use two regression methods to compare the groups. In
the follow-up analysis we look at the difference in the mean response at follow-up (POST ) comparing
the two groups: 𝑌𝑖1 = 𝛽 0 + 𝛽 1𝑋𝑖 + 𝜖𝑖 . Instead, in the change analysis we study the difference between
the average change (PRE-POST ) comparing the two groups: (𝑌𝑖1 − 𝑌𝑖0 ) = 𝛽 0 + 𝛽 1𝑋𝑖 + 𝜖𝑖 . From the
follow-up analysis, we have no evidence of a significant difference in the mean responses between
HD and LD groups at the POST stage, both for the d-score (𝛽 1 = −.04, 𝑆𝐸 = .08, 𝑝 = .66) and the
o-score (𝛽 1 = −.09, 𝑆𝐸 = .26, 𝑝 = .73). Similarly, the change analysis does not evidence differences
between groups in the average change between the beginning and the end of the experiment, both
for the d-score (𝛽 1 = −.09, 𝑆𝐸 = .10, 𝑝 = .38) and the o-score (𝛽 1 = .1, 𝑆𝐸 = .27, 𝑝 = .71).
In summary, after the exposure to four weeks of music recommendations we found a slight
change in implicit association (H6) and openness (H7), but we have not evidenced any particular
influence by the degree of diversity at which participants were exposed.
5.4.2 Stereotype Analysis. The results of this section of the EMF questionnaire are displayed in
Figure 24, 25, and 26 (Appendix B) respectively for the listening contexts, the musical properties
and the artists’ characteristics that participants associated with Electronic Music (EM). Hereafter,
we summarise the main results. As done for the d-score and the o-score, we compare exclusively
the measurements taken at the beginning of the study (PRE), at the end of the listening sessions
(COND), and at the end of the study (POST ).
Among the eight contexts presented in the survey, participants indicate that they would preferentially listen to EM while doing a dynamic and energetic activity (partying, running, commuting,
and shopping). On the contrary, they disagree that EM is suitable for being listened to during
activities that require a higher level of calm or concentration (sleeping, studying, and relaxing or
working).17 Nevertheless, the exposure to recommendations did not largely affect the opinion of the
participants. Indeed, performing a Wilcoxon signed-rank test between PRE-COND and PRE-POST,
for six contexts out of eight no statistically significant difference (𝑝 < 0.05) have been found.
Likewise, by using the Mann-Whitney U test we have not found significant differences between the
HD and LD participants’ responses, indicating that the level of diversity did not differently affect
the participants.
17 There is some ambiguity about the definition of working which may have influenced the responses. Indeed, depending

upon the type of work, it may be considered an energetic or a calm activity.
22

Assessing the Impact of Music Recommendation Diversity on Listeners: A Longitudinal Study

,,

The only two contexts wherein we found significant differences are running and shopping. In
the former case, the LD group is strongly convinced about the use of EM for running, with the
percentage of agreement passing from 62% in PRE to 76% in COND and POST. In the HD group, we
observe an opposite tendency, passing from an agreement of 73% in PRE to 66% and then 68% in
COND and POST. These results support the idea that being exposed only to trance music, a highenergy kind of music, may affect the listeners in associating EM with a high-energy kind of activity
like running. On the contrary, while exploring different facets of EM listeners may have realised
that some genres are not fitted for being listened to while running. Instead, in the case of shopping
we see that both groups start disagreeing in the PRE measurement (HD: 52%, LD: 62%), but then
over the course of the study arrive at a more balanced situation between agreement, disagreement
and neutral responses. Observing less extreme responses among participants is reasonable being
shopping an activity not so dynamic, for instance in comparison to running, neither so calm, as for
instance studying.
Similarly, the musical properties that participants associate with EM tracks have not been largely
affected by the recommendations. Among the four selected features, participants changed their
opinion only on the presence of acoustic instruments, especially the ones in the HD group. Indeed,
for them we find a significant difference (𝑝 = .01, 𝐶𝐿𝐸𝑆 = .32) both comparing PRE-COND and
PRE-POST measurements. Moreover, the Mann-Whitney U test confirms the significant difference
between the HD and the LD groups’ responses both in COND and POST measurements (𝑝 = .04,
𝐶𝐿𝐸𝑆 = .61). Observing the distribution in Figure 25, we may notice that at the beginning 79% of
HD participants disagree on the fact that EM had mostly acoustic instruments, while in the COND
and POST measurements only about 50% disagree. On the contrary, the percentage for the LD
group remains quite stable over the course of the three months. This is consistent with the fact
that the LD group has been exposed only to trance music, which rarely has parts with acoustic
instruments. On the contrary, HD participants listening to genres such as Electroacoustic may have
changed their idea about the acousticness of EM.
Lastly, analysing which characteristics participants associate with EM artists (Figure 26), no
statistically significant differences have been found between HD and LD groups. Only in terms of
age, we find a difference between PRE-COND and PRE-POST measurements.
5.5

End-of-Study Survey Analysis

The analysis of the End-of-Study (EoS) survey reveals a few more qualitative insights that complement what is presented in the previous sections. First, we analyse participants’ answers concerning
the openness and appreciation of EM, before, during and after participating in the study. Then,
we focus on a set of stereotypes to see how exposure to EM recommendations has affected the
participants’ opinions. We recall that the survey is formed by three main groups of items, the first
asking about the experience of participants before the study, the second during, and the third after
the study.
The survey contains 16 Likert items to measure the participants’ openness in listening to EM
and 16 items for measuring appreciation of EM, divided into 6 items asking for participants’ beliefs
before, 6 during, and 4 after participating in the study. By analysing these three sets separately, we
may get an idea about how participants perceived a change in their openness and appreciation
of EM due to their participation in the study. Figure 9 presents the distribution of the responses
for the whole group of participants. We avoid reporting results separately for the HD and LD
groups because no significant difference has been found between their responses. Analysing the
internal consistency of the sets of items computing Cronbach’s alpha (𝛼), we observe an acceptable
consistency in the three sets. Indeed, for the openness items we have: before 𝛼 = .88, during 𝛼 = .82,
and after 𝛼 = .72. For the appreciation items: before 𝛼 = .90, during 𝛼 = .86, and after 𝛼 = .77.
23

Therefore, we may assume that the items properly reflect the two concepts that we wanted to
measure.
Focusing on the openness in listening to EM, we notice that whilst participants’ responses
before the study were quite balanced around the neutral response, even if with high variance
(M=2.94 ± 1.31). When asked about their openness during and after the study, they averagely
declared to be more open in comparison with the beginning (respectively with 𝑀 = 3.43 ± 0.95,
and 𝑀 = 3.48 ± 1.08). Therefore, their perceptions are in line with the results of Section 5.4 wherein
an overall increase in openness was found by looking at the results obtained from the Guttman
scale. In terms of appreciation, we notice a similar trend with an initial balanced situation at the
beginning of the study (𝑀 = 3.07 ± 1.27), that increases towards more positive responses over the
12 weeks (𝑀 = 3.36 ± 0.99 and 𝑀 = 3.67 ± 1.01, respectively during and after the study).

Fig. 9. Distribution of responses for the openness (dark blue) and appreciation (light blue, dashed) 5-point
Likert scale. Response 1 corresponds to strong disagreement with the items, and 5 to strong agreement.

The second focus of our analysis is on comparing four items describing four stereotypes of EM,
reported in Figure 10 together with the distribution of the responses. In this case, it displays the
distribution for the HD and LD groups separately, because the impact of the recommendations on
these items has been indeed mediated by their diversity.
For the first item analysed (“I listen to EM only for partying”), we observe that prior to the study
participants had on average a balanced response towards this stereotype (HD: 2.98 ± 1.06, LD:
3.17 ± 0.97). However, during the study the two groups realise that may be restrictive to consider
EM only for partying, with an overall decrease in their average response (HD: 2.47 ± 1.03, LD:
2.56 ± 1.07). In the case of the second item (“I believe Electronic Music has mostly fast tempo and high
energy”), we observe a similar behaviour. In the beginning, participants strongly agree with this
statement (HD: 4.26 ± 0.66, LD: 4.15 ± 0.68), but then after the study they changed their opinion
(HD: 3.51 ± 1.1, LD: 3.69 ± 0.83), agreeing less strongly to the fact that EM has a mostly fast tempo
and high energy.
The next considered item (“I think of Electronic Music as a varied genre with several sub-styles”)
presents an opposite situation in confront to the former two. Indeed, at the beginning on average
participants neither agree nor disagree significantly with the statement (HD: 3.02 ± 1.12, LD:
3.19 ± 1.0). However, participating in the study made them change their opinion about it, agreeing
much more in percentage than before (HD: 4.21 ± 0.77, LD: 3.85 ± 0.77). Similarly, also in the case
of the fourth item considered (“I believe that Electronic Music could fit in different contexts”), we
observe a neutral position of participants at the beginning (HD: 3.37 ± 1.05, LD: 3.35 ± 0.9), which
later agree more with the fact that EM may fit in different contexts (HD: 4.12 ± 0.73, LD: 3.83 ± 0.72).

before (clean bar) and after (dashed bar) the participation in the study. Response 1 corresponds to “Totally
Disagree” with the item, and 5 to “Totally Agree”.

It is interesting to note that the responses in these two latter items are the only ones for which we
found a significant difference between HD and LD subjects. Indeed, by performing a Mann-Whitney
U test we obtain a p-value of .01 and .02 and a CLES of .65 and .62. This indicates that, even if
for both groups the exposure to recommendation affected the beliefs about how varied EM may
be and how it may fit in different contexts, in the case of the HD group this shift has been more
pronounced.

DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS

In this section, we discuss the results previously presented with the aim of defining, first, to what
extent listeners’ implicit and explicit attitudes towards an unfamiliar music genre can be affected by
exposure to music recommendations? (RQ1), and second, what is the relationship between music
recommendation diversity and the impact on listeners’ attitudes (RQ2). We focus on four main aspects:
impact on discovery (Section 6.1), implicit association (Section 6.2), openness (Section 6.3), and
stereotypes (Section 6.4). Moreover, in each section we present the limitations and future work.
6.1

Impact on Discovery

The most pronounced role that recommendation diversity plays in our study is with respect to
the curiosity generated in the participants when exposed to music during the listening sessions.
Indeed, the listeners’ willingness to explore Electronic Music (EM) playlists is significantly higher
if exposed to highly diverse recommendations. Having in mind that EM was mostly unfamiliar
to the subjects in our study, we believe that when listeners are not familiar with a music genre, a
diversified set of recommendations could increase their willingness in exploring such music. A message
sent to us by a study participant supports this hypothesis: “Hello! It was a pleasure participating, I
discovered new artists that I really liked! Happy to have contributed to your study :) Thank you!”.
25

This is particularly important for the design of music recommender systems in streaming platforms, the digital places where most people land to discover new music [3, 17, 51]. In offline settings,
several studies have investigated the role that diversity may play, e.g [24], but to our knowledge this
is the first longitudinal user study that measures the long-term impact of recommendation diversity
on music discovery. Recent works by Liang and Willemsen [58, 59] show that it is possible to favour
exploration of distant music genres both in the short and long term by nudging listeners through
specific design choices, for instance presenting such genres in the top of the recommendation lists.
Starting from their findings, we believe that by mixing nudging mechanisms with diversification
techniques practitioners may design recommendations that notably improve the experience of
discovering unfamiliar music.
Nevertheless, the first limitation of this work rises from the definition of discovery itself. Indeed,
if as Nowak suggests discoveries are “affective responses to music content that occur within
individuals’ life narratives and mediate their interpretation and definition of music” [73], we argue
that the responses resulting from the participation in our study cannot be compared to what
listeners usually experience in less artificial situations wherein they are exposed to music. Under
a different lens, focusing on discovery strategies and behavioural attitudes Garcia-Gathright and
colleagues [28] show how explorative goals may vary according to the listeners’ needs. A further
step could be to link the various overt behaviours to people’s affective responses, to evaluate if the
discovery mediated by algorithmic recommendations has some shared values with other non-digital
forms of curation (e.g., a DJ tracklist created for a live event).
6.2

Impact on Implicit Association

The exposure to music recommendations helped participants in deconstructing part of the preexisting positive or negative association to EM, developing a more neutral attitude during the twelve
weeks. The role of diversity here seems not significant, having the two groups of participants similarly behaved. In fact, we argue that the tendency of the HD group to decrease more significantly
in comparison to the LD group is because of the unbalance created by the different dropout rates.
Based on that, we hypothesise that when listeners are not familiar with a music genre, to receive
repeated recommendations could mitigate the valence of the implicit association with such music.
The results obtained deviate from the findings in [99], where positive implicit attitudes towards
facial images of people from two cultures, namely Indian and West African, are developed by mere
exposure to music from such cultures. However, the types of association and stimuli that listeners
experienced in our study are undoubtedly different.
The following reasons may be at the root of the development of neutral attitudes towards EM in
the presented study. First and in line with the previous point on the discovery, the experimental
setting mediated the affective response, also influencing the implicit association. The tendency of
the participants to associate neutral valence with EM genres could be motivated by the artificiality of
the events wherein participants listened to the music. Second, given the participants’ unfamiliarity
with the genre, it is understandable that they did not develop any positive or negative attachment
to genre labels that they might have never heard of before the study.
As elegantly discussed by McLeod [64], genre namings are strictly tied to the EM communities
behind which people identify, also influencing the dynamics of group formation. Therefore, we
hypothesise that most of the genres shown in the SC-IAT test were only labels to the study
participants, and remained as such given that no mechanism of bounding was incentivized. Indeed,
no information about the genre of the tracks listened to was provided during or after the listening
sessions. Under this lens, receiving neither positive nor negative responses from the participants
may be seen as the desired result in the long term, which however needs further analysis to be
understood in depth.

,,

Impact on Openness

Whilst listeners’ implicit association with EM became more moderate throughout the study, their
openness to listening to EM increased. This indicates that in the long term exposure to unfamiliar
music could favour listeners in being less reluctant in approaching a genre previously unknown.
This finding does not come totally anew, partly confirming results from the literature on the impact
of repeated exposure to music.
Diversity here seems to motivate in particular participants who started the experiment affirming
to be not open in listening EM. Indeed, subjects who passed from not being open to being open in
listening to EM for one hour or more a week are in the HD group twice the size of the LD group.
Still, the impact of recommendation diversity is apparently not significant. Moreover, contrary
to the implicit association, participants’ openness was more consistently affected right after the
conditioning stage than at the end of the study. Connecting this with the impact on discovery, we
deduce that openness is highly influenced by exposure, but such influence decays rapidly when
listeners stop to be exposed to recommendations. In light of this, we support the idea that when
listeners are not familiar with a music genre, repeated exposure to recommendations could increase
their openness in listening to such music. A message sent by one of the participants of the HD group
right after the end of the COND stage supports this intuition: “Thank you so much [...] It was very
interesting and a good opportunity to learn about this musical genre.”.
Again, the settings of the experiment may have influenced the outcomes responses. In fact,
participants were requested to be highly focused while listening to the music during the study, a
condition which is not quite frequent in today’s listening practices where music is often relegated
to the background while performing other activities [68]. This could have affected the openness
more consistently in comparison if tracks would have been passively listened to, for instance,
while walking in a mall or while working. Repeating the experiment in a controlled non-online
environment may lead to more precise results in this regard.
Furthermore, the openness measured using the Guttman scale has its own limitations. Indeed,
listeners’ openness in listening to EM could be determined by an overall curiosity in discovering
music. For instance, a listener with very heterogeneous musical tastes could be open to listening
every day to one hour of electronic music, one hour of classical music, one hour of rock music, and
more. On the contrary, a very homogeneous listener would avoid listening to electronic, classical
and rock music at the same time if disliked. We foresee the analysis of participants’ openness in
listening to EM with regard to their overall tendency of listening to varied music.
6.4

Impact on Stereotypes

What emerges from the analysis of the results is that the participants’ idea of EM is quite stereotypical, and probably based exclusively on mainstream Electronic Dance Music artists.
Indeed, listeners not familiar with EM may fall into the trap of misinterpreting it as music
composed only with electronic instruments (e.g., drum machine, sampler, synthesizer). Instead,
acoustic instruments, even if sampled, filtered, or generally modified, have always been used by
EM artists. Under this lens, the fact that acousticness is the only feature on which participants’
changed their idea after the exposure to recommendations does not come as a surprise. Moreover,
the stereotype that EM is only for parties, and the common belief that it has mostly a fast tempo
and high energy, have been partly deconstructed by the exposure to music such as ambient,
electroacoustic or chill out respectively in sessions 2, 4 and 18 of the HD group. Nevertheless, the
characterization of EM as Energetic and Rhythmic is quite common also in scientific literature, e.g.,
[81], and participants of the LD group at some level experienced this aspect of EM. Besides, another
accomplishment of this study is to show that listeners exposed to diversified recommendations
27

,,

Lorenzo Porcaro, Emilia Gómez, & Carlos Castillo

may have a better understanding of the variety of EM culture, and realise that this music may fit in
different contexts, not only for partying. Therefore, we deduce that exposing listeners not familiar
with a music genre to a set of diversified recommendations, showing the different facets of such genre,
could deconstruct pre-existing stereotypes. This finding is in line with the music psychology literature
on the influence of music exposure.
Likewise, the representation that participants have of EM artists is quite stereotypical, and also
in this case it was something expected. EM artists are, according to them, mostly men, white, under
40 years old and coming from developed and high-income countries. In this case, we did not expect
that recommendations would affect participants’ opinions, mostly for two reasons which however
are also two limitations of this work. First, participants’ origin has been purposely restricted to a
small part of the world, normally labelled as Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich and Democratic
(WEIRD) societies. Similarly, also the EM part of the study is somehow biased towards Western
artists. In fact, the semi-automatic method for creating the dataset has produced recommendation
lists that reflect the variety of EM in terms of different genres, but not its variety as music culture
played in different parts of the world.
In conclusion, Figure 11 depicts the rationale behind our study by using an analogy about how
people create mental models or abstractions of a field, using as an example geometric shapes. If a
geometric shapes recommender system exposes a user not familiar with shapes only to squares,
even if she may interact with squares having different colours, her idea of geometric shapes will be
centred around squares. Instead, a system recommending squares, circles and triangles may help
her in learning about other geometric shapes, and eventually she will interact also with those, or
maybe not. In the end, one of the functions of recommendation diversity may be to help users learn
what different shapes are.

CONCLUSIONS

The impact assessment of music RS with regard to people’s behaviour, attitudes, habits or beliefs,
is an active and challenging research topic which is attracting more and more practitioners from
different disciplines. Until now, simulation methods have been the most explored approach by the
RS community to study the dynamics between users and items, and undoubtedly they have shed a
light on several behavioural aspects of such interaction. Nevertheless, the fact that behaviourism is
not enough has already being pointed out by Ekstrand and Willemsen [20]. The focus only on what
users do, listen or consume is indeed one of the main limitations we find in music RS research,
which motivated us in designing this longitudinal study.
We did not target or expect to drastically change the listening habits of the study participants
because the function of RS is not, and should not be, to manipulate listeners’ towards specific artists
or genres. Moreover, the socio-cultural background, empathetic and affective response, generational
differences, music education and many more aspects through life define what people listen to, and

with this regard, recommender systems are only one of the many ways thanks to which people
discover and interact with music [10]. Nevertheless, the extensive use of music streaming services,
especially by young generations, wherein algorithmic recommendations play a central role, raise
questions in terms of human agency and autonomy of the next generation of music listeners [16],
questions that RS practitioners should not neglect.

DIVERSIFICATION DESIGN

This appendix outlines the diversification method designed to create the music recommendations for
this study. Section A.1 describes the creation of the dataset, containing different kinds of Electronic
Music (EM). After selecting a pool of approximately 1.5 thousand tracks from the dataset, several
audio models were explored to understand what type of tracks’ representation better served the
purpose of diversifying the recommendations, as described in Section A.2. Lastly, we describe in
Section A.3 how starting from the tracks’ embeddings we built the diversified recommendation
lists to which study participants were exposed.
A.1

Dataset

One of the goals of the study was to expose people not familiar with the EM culture to different
genres which could fit under this label. Therefore, our aim was to select as many as possible
varied tracks to represent the richness of this culture, even if we did not aim to create a dataset
representing its entirety. In order to do that, we designed a semi-automatic method based on two
sources: Wikipedia and Every Noise at Once.19
The initial step consisted in retrieving the list of EM genres from the Wikipedia page “List
of electronic music genres” [100]. Whilst several taxonomies and hierarchies of EM genres and
subgenres have been published, we believe that the information on Wikipedia properly represents
the variety of EM, enough precisely for our purposes. From that source, we obtained a set of 20
genres and 320 subgenres.20 The second step was to map these subgenres to the ones part of the
Every Noise at Once (ENO) website. ENO is described by its creator Glenn Mcdonald as “an ongoing
attempt at an algorithmically-generated, readability-adjusted scatter-plot of the musical genrespace, based on data tracked and analysed for several genre-shaped distinctions by Spotify”[86].
Born as a debugging tool, in its current form the website presents for each genre label a playlist
formed by approximately one hundred tracks, considered representative of the genre by Spotify
algorithms. Mapping Wikipedia to ENO, we linked to the 20 genres only 181 subgenres, for
which we retrieved the corresponding playlists.
It should be noted a few aspects of the aforementioned approach. First, even if we are aware
of the dynamical, intrinsic, ambiguous, and context-dependent nature of concepts such as genre
and style [77], approaching music cultures as broad as Electronic Music is quite natural to identify
different aesthetic and social characteristics in its several subgenres [64]. For instance, even without
knowing anything about EM genres, it is possible to recognize the differences between the fast
breakbeats of the Drum and Bass and the slow-tempo beats of Downtempo. As a matter of fact,
in a previous study we showed how familiarity with styles and subgenres highly influence the
perceived diversity of people exposed to EM tracks [78]. Even if it could have left out some genres,
pursuing a bottom-down approach to find representative Electronic Music, starting from genre
labels arriving at tracks, seems to us the most obvious approach to creating a varied EM dataset.
Second, the choice of using ENO playlists to select candidate tracks could be criticised because of
the opaqueness of the Spotify algorithms. Indeed, it is not possible to find the exact description of
the procedure which assigns a genre label to artists and albums. Even having in mind this limitation,
after exploring in depth the ENO website we believe that it provides a good representation of the
genres on its map, sharing the idea of ENO creator that “the point of the map, as with the genres, is
not to resolve disputes but to invite you to explore music” [63]. Under this lens, we do not argue
19 https://everynoise.com
20 We refer to genre when indicating the top-level genre labels in the Wikipedia hierarchy, highlighted in bold. Instead, we

refer to the others as subgenres.
35

that the classification in this study is the ultimate one, but one of the possible classifications which
may help listeners navigate the EM culture.
After a preliminary exploration of the dataset, we performed a manual cleaning of some of the
music selected to be sure that crossover genres would not enter into the final listening sessions.
We do not argue if Electronic Rock may be considered Electronic music, Rock music, or both, but
we believe that crossover music did not fit the purpose of our study. In the end, we restricted the
dataset to 20 genres (ambient, bass music, breakbeat, chill out, disco, drum and bass, electroacoustic,
electronica, garage, hardcore, hardstyle, hauntology, house, IDM, jungle, noise, plunderphonics, techno,
trance, videogame), and 165 subgenres listed in Appedix B (Table 7). At that point, we had a pool
of around 16 thousand tracks (∼100 tracks for subgenre) listenable on Spotify.
Further filtering was applied by looking at the popularity of the tracks. Indeed, several studies
have proven the influence of familiarity on music preferences [13]. In order to avoid creating a
popularity effect in our study, i.e. participants’ ratings influenced by the popularity of a track, we
filtered the dataset by using two indicators: 1) Spotify track’ popularity; 2) YouTube view count. In
detail, we implement the following procedure. From the 16 thousand tracks for which we already
had the Spotify ID, we filtered out the ones with popularity less than the first quartile Q1 and major
than the third quartile Q3 computed on the Spotify popularity indicator. For the remaining ones, we
made use of a Python wrapper to search with the YouTube API for the corresponding video by using
the track names. As a result, we obtain a total of approximately 8 thousand tracks with Spotify ID
and YouTube ID, already filtered by Spotify popularity. The last step was to further filter out tracks
according to the YouTube view count applying the same logic of Spotify popularity, including
only tracks with views between Q1 and Q3. After the second filtering, we randomly choose ten
tracks for each subgenre obtaining 1444 candidate tracks, for which finally we extracted the
audio embedding, as reported in the next section.
A.2

Audio Models

The use of deep representation models in MIR research is widespread and applied in several
retrieval and classification tasks, e.g., auto-tagging, instrument recognition, genre classification, and
ultimately music recommendations [103]. Nevertheless, the trustworthiness of such representations
is still under the scrutiny of the research community, partly because of the still low interpretability
in comparison to traditional hand-crafted music representations, usually informed by human music
domain knowledge [50]. Even if the goal of this study was not to perform a rigorous comparative
analysis of different music representation models, we were nevertheless interested in creating
diversity-aware content-based music recommendations, on the one hand, based on state-of-the-art
deep learning models, on the other hand enough interpretable to make us aware of the characteristics
underlying the diversification outcomes. Consequently, we first started exploring several deep
representation models, and then we attempted to interpret those by using a set of hand-crafted
features.
A.2.1 Deep Representation Models. We experimented with four audio representation models
available in Essentia [9], an open-source library for audio and music analysis. Notably, Essentia
provides Tensorflow deep learning models built on different architectures and trained with different
datasets, open sources and publicly available [5]. Among those available, we tested the following
models:
• EffNet–Discogs: EfficientNet [93] trained with the Discogs-Effnet Dataset (DED).
• MusicNN–MSD / MusicNN–MTT: MusicNN [76] trained with the Million Song Dataset
(MSD) [7] and the MagnaTagATune (MTT) dataset [55].
• VGGish–AudioSet: VGG [84] trained with the AudioSet dataset [30].
36

Assessing the Impact of Music Recommendation Diversity on Listeners: A Longitudinal Study

,,

A detailed description of the models, datasets and implementations can be found online,21 but
here we discuss a few aspects relevant to our study. First, we employed these models as feature
extractors, i.e. to obtain an embedded representation of each audio in our dataset. However, their
intended purposes are quite different. For instance, VGG was proposed to tackle the task of image
recognition, while MusicNN primarily focuses on auto-tagging. Therefore, our final choice was
based not on the architecture which better performs according to its original scope, but on the
feature extractor that better worked according to our objectives. Second, we intentionally selected
a quite heterogeneous set of models, especially in terms of datasets used in the training stage.
Indeed, AudioSet is formed by almost two million clips annotated using sound labels not always
specific to music (e.g. footstep, bark, cutlery). Instead, MSD and MTT datasets are annotated with 50
tags describing the genre, instrumentation or also mood of the tracks. Lastly, DED contains tracks
annotated with 400 music styles according to the taxonomy of the crowdsourced database Discogs.
Once selected the models (EffNet–Discogs, MusicNN–MSD, MusicNN–MTT, VGGish–AudioSet),
we extracted the audio embeddings for the 1444 candidate tracks part of our dataset. In the former
three cases, we obtained 200-dimensional embeddings while from the VGGish-AudioSet we get
1024-dimensional embeddings. At that point, we were interested in a model which could coherently
represent Electronic Music according to the genre labels that we already got. Indeed, assuming
that the tracks representative of one genre, i.e. coming from the same Every Noise at Once playlist,
should be more similar to one another in comparison to the tracks of another genre, our problem
was translated into measuring how good the embeddings placed tracks from the same genre near
in the embedded space. Therefore, we used the tracks’ genre labels to create 20 clusters, and then
we measured the consistency of each cluster by performing a Silhouette analysis [82].
In brief, Silhouette analysis measures how much an item of a cluster is similar to other items
of its own cluster compared to the ones of other clusters. It ranges from -1 to 1, where negative
values indicate that an item has been poorly clustered, while positive values mean that an item has
been properly matched. Given the high dimensionality of the embeddings, we chose to use cosine
similarity to measure the distance between items. An example of silhouette scores for the 20 genre
clusters is reported in Figure 12, computed using the cosine distance between the EffNet-Discogs
embeddings. The score of each genre is computed by averaging the scores of its corresponding
tracks. Among the others, we see that Jungle tracks are well-clustered together (.28), while on
the contrary Hardcore tracks seem not (–.29). Other genres such as House have almost half tracks
well-clustered while the other half poorly, obtaining an average score around zero (–.08).
Silhouette analysis is commonly performed to validate the output of clustering algorithms,
however, in our case we employed it as a tool to validate which of the four models provides us
with more consistent embeddings according to our “ground-truth” labels. Averaging the silhouette
scores over all the twenty genres, we obtained the best score using the EffNet-Discogs model (–
.09), followed by VGGish-AudioSet (–.11) and then MusicNN (MSD: –.16, MTT : –.17). Whilst the
difference between models seems not significant, we believe that the use of the Discogs dataset may
have boosted the performance of the EfficientNet architecture in creating audio representations
which better reflect differences between Electronic Music tracks. Indeed, born originally as an EM
database, Discogs is a huge source of knowledge of such culture. In order to properly compare
the different models, each architecture should have been trained with the Discogs database, a task
left to practitioners interested in understanding better how deep representations behave with EM
tracks. From now on, when mentioning embeddings we implicitly refer to the ones generated by
the EffNet-Discogs model.

score over all the genres. In the legend, the values in the parenthesis indicate the average genre score.

Figure 13 displays a two-dimensional representation of the embedded space obtained with this
model. In the centre of the circle, we notice a quite messy situation with tracks from different
genres placed near each other. However, going near the border we see a few clusters more defined,
for instance the Trance tracks on the right or Drum and Bass on the bottom. We see also how genres
which shared music properties are clustered near each other, such as Drum and Bass–Jungle, or
Hardcore–Hardstyle. From the scatter plot, we may also have an intuition about the logic behind the
placing of the points in the space according to characteristics such as the BPM or the softness of
the sounds. However, to interpret in depth the nature of the embeddings, we continue our analysis
focusing on a series of hand-crafted features as explained in the next section.
A.2.2 Hand-crafted Music Features. Following a first exploration of the embeddings, we scrutinised
in depth their relationship with four music features: tempo, danceability, acousticness and instrumentalness. The reason why we selected these features is twofold. First, the embeddings seemed
to be in some way informative of the distribution of those. For instance, the tempo apparently
decreased going from bottom to top, while the danceability in the opposite way. Second, by using
these features we had the opportunity to verify the reliability of Essentia’s feature extractor22
and the Spotify API. Both present advantages and disadvantages, and according to the available
resources one could prefer one method rather than the other.
Indeed, a main drawback of Essentia is the need for the audio track file to extract the features,
while using the Spotify API just with the track ID it is possible to access several audio features.
However, Spotify algorithms are proprietary, while being Essentia open source it is possible to verify
the exact functioning of the extraction process. Eventually, we checked the Pearson correlation
coefficient (𝜌) between the features extracted with Essentia and Spotify, and using the tracks in
our dataset we found a positive correlation: tempo (𝜌 = .29, 𝑝 < .01), instrumentalness (𝜌 = .42,
𝑝 < .01), danceability (𝜌 = .50, 𝑝 < .01), and acousticness (𝜌 = .61, 𝑝 < .01). Therefore, in terms of

analysis no particular difference should emerge if using one method rather than the other. From
now on, when referring to features we implicitly refer to the ones extracted with Essentia.
The track features’ distribution (Figure 14) highlight some characteristics of Electronic Music
in the dataset. First, most of the tracks have a tempo of between 120 and 150 BPM, with some
outliers over 160 and under 90 BPM. It is worth noting that tempo estimation algorithms suffer
from the problem of the so-called octave errors i.e. assigning 80 instead of 160 BPM, or vice versa
[83], hence some of these outliers could be a result of these errors. In terms of danceability, the
extractor returns values between 0 and 3, where higher values mean more danceable. We have the
majority of tracks with values between 1 and 2, with 20% scoring less than 1 and a little percentage
scoring more than 2. Acousticness and instrumentalness are computed as probabilities ranging
from 0 to 1. In the case of the former, 0 means almost certainly no presence of acoustic instruments
while 1 is the opposite scenario. For the latter, 0 means almost certainly the presence of a singing
voice, while 1 the absence of singing voice parts. In our dataset, it is not surprising to observe that
the majority of the tracks are classified as non-acoustic, while we see that the presence of singing
voices is less skewed in comparison with the acousticness. Computing the correlation between
the four features, we found that danceability is negatively correlated with both acousticness and
instrumentalness (𝜌 = −.44, 𝑝 < .01 and 𝜌 = −.66, 𝑝 < .01), meaning that the more danceable
39

tracks in the dataset are the ones without acoustic instrumentation but with singing parts. Instead,
these two latter features were positively correlated among them (𝜌 = .31, 𝑝 < .01).
As the last step before defining the diversification strategy, we explored the link between the
embeddings and the hand-crafted features. In order to do that, we first divided into equally-sized
blocks the 2-dimensional projection of the embedded space created (see Figure 13). Then, we
assigned each track to a block according to its position in the space. Finally, in each block we
averaged the feature values of its tracks. Because of the non-uniform density of the embedded space,
tracks were not equally distributed among blocks. Figure 15 displays the four block-heatmaps
linking the features to the embedding distribution.
We may observe how the embeddings coherently clustered the tracks with regard to the selected
features. For instance, tracks with extreme tempos (more than 130 BPM and less than 110 BPM)
are distributed in the bottom and bottom-left of the embedded space. On the contrary, tracks
with high danceability are mostly in the left and top-left parts of the heatmap. Acousticness and
instrumentalness instead have higher values in the top-right corner. Further validation can be
obtained by looking at the relationship between the heatmaps and the genre clusters. For instance,

Fig. 15. Embeddings-features block distribution. The asterisk indicates correlation coefficients with 𝑝 < .001.
40

,,

the Drum and Bass, Hardcore and Hardstyle clusters located at the bottom of the plot correspond to
the blocks where the tempo is higher. The Techno, Trance and part of the House clusters on the left
instead are located where the danceability is higher. Instrumentalness goes up in correspondence
with Disco and Hauntology clusters, where also the acousticness is quite high.
This explorative analysis gives an intuition about how the embeddings may have incorporated
musical properties of the tracks, and the correlation coefficients between the x- and y-axis and four
features confirm some of our hypotheses. A positive correlation of the x-axis means that values
increase while going from left to right, while in the y-axis from down to top.
A.3

Diversity-aware Recommendations

The diversification process for creating the recommendation to which participants were exposed
during the study was based on two main criteria. First, we aimed at controlling the inter-list diversity
to present to one group of participants a varied selection of Electronic Music (EM) throughout the
20 listening sessions, while to the other group only a tiny fraction of EM. Second, we limit the
intra-list diversity for both groups, to avoid creating listening sessions too diverse and fragmented
to become potentially annoying. Especially having study participants not familiar with EM, to ask
them to listen in sequence, e.g. to a glitchy IDM track and then a soft Minimal Techno track could
have negatively impacted their listening experience, consequently affecting the drop-out rate.
Other design choices of the recommendations were the following. First, each list had to be formed
by four tracks to limit the length of the listening session. Second, each list had to contain tracks
with no more than three different genres. Indeed, even if in the previous sections we have shown
how the tracks’ embedding preserves some musical characteristics of EM genres, it is also true that
two tracks could be very near in the embedded space even if labelled differently.
Having in mind these aspects, we implemented the following strategies. In order to minimise the
intra-list diversity, we found for every track in the dataset the three nearest tracks, according to
the pairwise cosine distance between embeddings. These quadruples of tracks were the candidate
recommendation lists. Afterwards, to minimise the inter-list diversity, we selected 20 quadruples
from a single genre, while to maximise it we selected one quadruple for each of the 20 genres of
the dataset. Figure 16 shows the resulting recommendation lists obtained using these two different
diversification processes.

the average position of a list’s tracks. (A) displays the lists with low inter-list diversity (LD), while (B) lists

Lorenzo Porcaro, Emilia Gómez, & Carlos Castillo

We selected Trance as a seed genre of recommendation lists with low inter-list diversity (from
now on simply low diversity or LD) for the following reasons. First, it has a number of subgenres
which ensure some variability between lists, without exceeding like in the case of House (see Table
7). With regard to this aspect, further valid choices could have been Techno, Ambient or Hardcore.
However, Trance tracks have on average a higher silhouette score (Figure 12), meaning that in the
embedded space tracks were better clustered than the other genres. This aspect was important
to ensure to have enough candidates for creating coherent listening sessions with low intra-list
diversity. Lastly, Trance music reflects some stereotypes typical of electronic music: quite danceable,
with almost no use of acoustic instruments and a small presence of vocal parts. Hence, participants
exposed to LD recommendations interacted with a stereotypical idea of the EM culture, with few
variations in terms of musical properties. Even if differences between sessions existed because of
different characteristics of the Trance subgenres, a certain level of homogeneity was ensured by
having selected a single genre to create the recommendations.
On the contrary, to obtain high inter-list diversity (from now on simply high diversity or HD), we
picked a quadruple of tracks for each different genre, which was enough to ensure that participants
exposed to such recommendations would explore different facets of EM. These two diversification
strategies effectively led to statistically significant differences between recommendation lists. In
detail, we tested these design objectives:
– The average inter-list diversity should be higher for the HD recommendations in comparison
to the LD recommendations.
– The average intra-list diversity should be equal for the recommendations created using the
two diversification strategies.
– The average difference between median values of the hand-crafted features should be higher
in the HD recommendations than in the LD ones.
According to the statistics presented in Table 6, the aforementioned design objectives were satisfied.
The objectives are further validated by the boxplot presented in Figure 19 (Appendix B) which
shows the features’ distribution.

Thanks to the aforementioned procedure, we created recommendation lists formed by 4 tracks, 20
with high and 20 with low diversity. In every list, tracks were selected to minimise their differences
according to the distance between their embeddings. The final step was to mix the four tracks
in each recommendation list to create a single audio file to be included in a listening session. To
accomplish that, we implemented the following procedure using Pysox, a Python wrapper around
Sox [8]. First, we randomly selected a 45-second excerpt for each track in the list. The sample rate
of each excerpt was converted to 48000Hz and the volume normalised to -3db. Then, we joined the
excerpts together including a 1-second fade-in and fade-out, to help the listeners recognize the
42

,,

start and the end of each track in the mix. At the end of this process, we obtained a 3-minutes mp3
audio for each recommendation list.
A final manual check of each audio was done to ensure that each listening session was properly
mixed. W also verified that the content in each audio was appropriate for the purpose of the study.
Indeed, it is not uncommon that lyrics in EM could contain references to sex, use of drugs, or
blasphemy. Whilst we do not want to advocate for a moral judgement of the artists’ forms of
expression, still we agreed that it was necessary to remove some tracks to respect every subjectivity
that might eventually participate in the study.
